'@solid-design-system/components': patch
---

Improved the `sd-audio` by:
- Replacing the seekbar slider by the new `sd-range` component.
- Implementing visual updates to match figma.
- Fixing an issue where dragging the slider was not updating the audio current time.

Adjusted `sd-range` colors to correctly match figma.

Added a new translation named `seconds`.
