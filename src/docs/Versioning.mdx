# Versioning

## General

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Versioned Components

To version components in your projects, follow these steps:

1. Modify the CDN URL from `../1-0-0/components/umd/solid-components.js` to `../1-0-0/versioned-components/umd/solid-components.js`. You can still cherry-pick the components you want to use, for example, `../1-0-0/versioned-components/es/button.js`.
2. Update the tags of your components to include their version, such as `sd-1-0-0-button` instead of `sd-button`.

Keep the following in mind for nested components:

- _Slotted components_, which are added by your app or website, are not automatically versioned. You need to version them yourself if necessary.
- _Nested components_, which are generated by the component itself, are automatically versioned (e.g., `sd-1-0-0-button` will generate an `sd-1-0-0-spinner` when in the loading state).
