# Versioning

## General

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Versioned components

In your projects, you can version components by following these steps:

1. Change the CDN url from `../1-0-0/components/umd/solid-components.js` to `../1-0-0/versioned-components/umd/solid-components.js`. You're still able to cherry-pick the components you want to use. For example, `../1-0-0/versioned-components/es/button.js`.
2. Change the tags of your components by including their version, for example, `sd-1-0-0-button` instead of `sd-button`.

For nested components have the following in mind:

- _Slotted components_, which are added by your app/website, are not automatically versioned, you have to version them yourself if needed.
- _Nested components_, which are generated by the component itself, are automatically versioned (e. g. `sd-1-0-0-button` will generate a `sd-1-0-0-spinner` when it has the loading state).
