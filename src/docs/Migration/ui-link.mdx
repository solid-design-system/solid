# `ui-link`

## ❌ attribute: `button`.

In the component library, styles were duplicated between `ui-link' and `ui-button'. This caused maintainability problems.

### Links that look like _buttons_

If you provide links that should look like buttons, you need to use the new `sd-button` replacement.
As soon as you set a `href` attribute, you can use all the attributes of an original HTML anchor, much more than before.
Check out the `sd-button` docs to see them.

### Links that look like _links_

The new `sd-link` (currently unavailable!) will provide styling for **inline** links that may span more than one line.
Only the `sd-link` can show `underline`.

## ❌ attribute: `icon`.

The `sd-button` and the `sd-link` don't have an `icon` attribute anymore. Instead, there's now a slot:

```html
<sd-button
  <ui-icon slot="icon-left" ...></ui-icon>.
</sd-button>.
```

See the `sd-button/Slots` story for examples. Note that you may need to manually add `skinning' data to invert the icon, as it's no longer provided by the button.

## ❌ attribute: `icon-option`.

The `sd-button` and the `sd-link` don't provide an `icon-option` attribute anymore. Instead, you can place icons in the main slot, which will automatically change the padding. (Will be implemented when `sd-icon` is developed).
If you want to catch the event, you should be able to handle it in your top component.

## ❌ attribute: `delay`.

The `sd-button` and the `sd-link` don't provide a `delay` attribute anymore.
If you want to catch the event, you should be able to handle it in your parent component. Have a look at the current implementation in the `ui-link` component.

## ❌ attribute: `conversion`.

The `sd-button` and the `sd-link` don't provide a `delay` attribute anymore. If you want to catch the event, you should be able to handle it in your parent component.

## ❌ CSS variables `--component-link-..., -component-button-...`

We dropped all component specific CSS variables. Instead you are now able to override colors and padding with the part selector, e. g.:

```css
sd-button::part(base) {
  background: pink;
  color: black;
}
```

As an alternative you can override CSS variables used in the element:

```css
sd-button {
  --sd-spacing-4: 15px; // overrides default 16px
}
```
