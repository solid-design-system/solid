# `ui-link`

Solid Components aim to emulate the default HTML behavior as closely as possible. The new `sd-link` component therefore supports a range of correctly typed attributes (e.g., `target: '_blank' | '_parent' | '_self' | '_top'`). Working alongside the `sd-button`, it replaces the `ui-link` with enhanced features and functionality. For a comprehensive understanding of all available attributes, refer to the `sd-link` documentation.

## ❌ Removed attribute: `button`

In the legacy component library, styles were duplicated between `ui-link` and `ui-button`, leading to maintainability issues.

### Links that look like _buttons_

If you have links that should resemble buttons, use the new `sd-button`. By setting a `href` attribute, you can leverage all attributes of an original HTML anchor, thereby providing more options than before. Refer to the `sd-button` documentation for further details.

### Links that look like _links_

The new `sd-link` offers styles for links that may span more than one line and always display an underline.

## ✨ New attribute: `standalone`

The `ui-link` posed two problems:

- The component automatically wraps to a new line, forcing subsequent content to a new line. This breaks away from the default `<a>` behavior, causing problems particularly in CMS Rich Text Editors where true inline behavior isn't possible.
- Icons within the component are always displayed inline, even if the text wraps across multiple lines. This often leads to misuse of the component and unexpected behavior.

`sd-link` resolves these issues with the `standalone` attribute that controls the layout of the icon and text within the component.

- `false` (Default): Icons are displayed inline with the text, mimicking the default `<a>` element behavior. Icons adjust their spacing according to the current font size.
- `true`: The link moves to a new line, with the icon and text displayed side-by-side, each in its own column.

## ✨ New attribute: `size`

The `sd-link` component offers three different sizes:

- The default size, `inherit`, adapts the font size from the parent element, especially useful for non-`standalone` links.
- The `lg` and `sm` sizes set predefined font sizes, beneficial for `standalone` links.

## 🔀 CSS Variables: `--component-link-..., --component-button-...`

Component-specific CSS variables have been discontinued. Now, you can override colors and padding using the part selector.

```css
sd-button::part(base) {
  background: pink;
  color: black;
}
```

Alternatively, you can override CSS variables used within the element.

```css
sd-button {
  --sd-spacing-4: 15px; // overrides default 16px
}
```

## ❌ Removed attribute: `icon`

The `sd-button` and `sd-link` no longer contain an `icon` attribute. They instead offer new `icon-left` and `icon-right` slots.

```html
<sd-button
  <sd-icon slot="icon-left" ...></sd-icon>.
</sd-button>.
```

## ❌ Removed attribute: `icon-option`

The `sd-button` and `sd-link` no longer offer an `icon-option` attribute. You can place icons in the main slot, which automatically adjusts the padding.

## ❌ Removed attributess: `delay` / `conversion`

The `sd-button` and `sd-link` no longer provide `delay` and `conversion` attributes. If you need to catch the event, handle it in your parent component. Refer to the existing `ui-link` component implementation for an example.
