# `ui-loading-spinner`

Use the new `sd-spinner` as a replacement.

## ✨ attribute: `color`

The `ui-loading-spinner` had its own color handling through global skinning. The `sd-spinner` uses the `color` attribute to set the color. This is more consistent with other components.

## ❌ fixed size

The `ui-loading-spinner` had a fixed size of `25px`. The `sd-spinner` is fully responsive and can be sized with CSS using the font-size property. The default size is `1em` which is `16px` by default.
