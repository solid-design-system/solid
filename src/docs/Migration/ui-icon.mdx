# `ui-icon`

Use the new `sd-icon` as a replacement. It tries to mirror the attributes of an original HTML button as much as possible, and therefore offers much more. Check out the `sd-button` docs to see them.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è independency from global-resources

You don't have to import `global-resources` with the icon-provider + JSONs with a list of icons anymore. Instead you implement your so-called resolver. This makes the handling a lot more flexible and more performant. Check out the `sd-icon` docs to see how to do this.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è flexible size and color handling

`size` and `color` are inherited the from the parent's `font-size` and `(text-)color`.

## ‚ú® attribute: `color`

To make coloring flexible and as easy as possible for skinning at the same time we implemented the `color` attribute.

1. `currentColor` (default) inherits the text color from the parent element and is therefore close to the curent CSS variable handling.
2. `primary` and `white` are self-explanatory ‚Äì both per default are skinnable.

## ‚ú® attribute: `src`

You can now use the `src` attribute to set an icon from an URL.

## ‚ú® attribute: `label`

You can now describe the icon for screen readers.

## üîÄ attributes `icon`, `type`, `variant` ‚Üí `name`

We dropped the `icon`, `type` and `variant` attributes.

1. `variant` is not needed anymore, as the color is set via the color attribute.
2. `type` and `icon` are now merged into the `name` attribute, e. g. `name='content/letter'`

You have to make sure, that your resolver works correctly. Please check out the examples in the `sd-icon` docs for `global-resources` and `global-resources-overriden`.

## üîÄ CSS variables `--component-icon-...`

We dropped all component (!) specific CSS variables. Instead you are now able to override the icon's color with `currentColor`.
