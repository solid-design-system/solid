# `ui-button`

Use the new `sd-button` as a replacement. It tries to mirror the attributes of an original HTML button as much as possible, and therefore offers much more. Check out the `sd-button` docs to see them.

## ✨ attribute: `load`

If you use a `ui-button' that shows a loading state, you had to manually handle things. Now you can just set the `loading`argument which sets an`sd-spinner`, preserves the current content (and therefore the width) and handles all the necessary HTML and A11y features.

## 🔀 attribute argument: `variant/transparent`

The argument is now called `variant/tertiary` to better reflect the hierarchy of buttons. To improve UX, it behaves differently on hover (changes background instead of underlining).

## ❌ attribute argument: `variant/plain`

Currently, we don't provide a way to manually set negative margins if you want to align a tertiary button horizontally. Please handle this in your application.
Setting something like the following should do the trick (including skinnability):

```css
sd-button.align-to-left { }}
  margin-left: calc(var(--sd-spacing-4, 1rem) * -1);
}
```

## ❌ attribute: `icon`

The `sd-button` doesn't have an `icon` attribute. Instead, there's now a slot:

```html
<sd-button
  <ui-icon slot="icon-left" ...></ui-icon>.
</sd-button>.
```

See the `sd-button/Slots` story for examples. Note that you may have to manually add `skinning' data to invert the icon, as it's no longer provided by the button.

## ❌ automatic color inversion

As we want single components as independent and robust as possible the `sd-button` doesn't automatically inverts it's colors on behalf of CSS variables by higher elements in the DOM.
Instead you just have to add the `inverted` attribute.

## ❌ CSS variables `--component-button-...`

We dropped all component specific CSS variables. Instead you are now able to override colors and padding with the part selector, e. g.:

```css
sd-button::part(base) {
  background: pink;
  color: black;
}
```

As an alternative you can override CSS variables used in the element:

```css
sd-button {
  --sd-spacing-4: 15px; // overrides default 16px
}
```
