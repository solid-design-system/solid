# Solid Design System Monorepo

This monorepo houses the components, placeholder images, and design tokens for the Solid Design System.

## Packages

### 1. Solid

The solid package contains all the components that make up the Solid Design System.

### 2. Placeholder

The placeholder package provides placeholder images that can be used alongside the Solid Design System components during development and prototyping.

### 3. Tokens

The tokens package contains all the design tokens used in the Solid Design System.

## Quick Start

To get started with the code steps, follow these instructions:

We use `pnpm` package manager, so make sure to have it installed globally before you start.

- https://pnpm.io/installation

```
pnpm i
cd packages/components
pnpm dev
```

These steps will install the necessary dependencies, navigate to the "packages/components" directory, and start the development server. You can now take a look at our existing components or begin working on new ones.

### Helpful Commands

```
$ pnpm fix           // fix all formatting and linting in repo
$ pnpm verify        // run tests and builds in repo
$ cd packages/components
  && pnpm dev        // start dev server
  && pnpm test       // run tests
```
