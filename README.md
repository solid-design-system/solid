# Solid Design System Monorepo

This monorepo houses the components, placeholder images, and design tokens for the Solid Design System. This structure allows us to centralize our design assets, maintain consistency, and streamline development across our projects.

## Packages

### Solid

The solid package contains all the components that make up the Solid Design System. These components are ready to be integrated into your projects, providing a consistent and cohesive user interface.

Usage:

To integrate Solid Design System components into your project, you can import them from the solid package and customize them as needed. Make sure to follow the usage guidelines and documentation provided in the solid package.

### Placeholder

The placeholder package provides placeholder images that can be used alongside the Solid Design System components during development and prototyping.

Usage:

To use these placeholder images, import them from the placeholder package and replace them with actual images once your project is ready for production. These placeholders are helpful for layout and design testing.

### Tokens

The tokens package contains all the design tokens used in the Solid Design System. These tokens define our design choices, such as colors, typography, spacing, and more.
