## Common Use Cases

- Display content and actions on a particular topic in a flexible layout.
- Showcase new or featured products and services.
- Display recent news or important updates.
- Provide a brief overview of key features or benefits of a product or service.
- Present upcoming events or webinars with concise details and links.
- Offer a preview of blog posts, articles, or video content.

## Usage Guidelines

### Content

- Use brief, impactful headings to convey the message quickly; the main content should complement the corresponding heading.
- Ensure that the information in each item is independent from others around it; avoid cross-referencing items placed close together.
- Do not use the metadata slot as an image caption or to convey any other kind of information but metadata.

### Layout and Orientation

- Use a horizontal layout for an impactful, standalone teaser.
- Prefer a vertical layout when placing a teaser within a block of text, so it flows naturally with surrounding copy.
- Arrange multiple teasers in a grid for a cohesive user experience, maintaining consistent alignment and padding.
- Use the “breakpoint” attribute to override default layout behavior across different screen sizes, but ensure the teaser adapts effectively.

### Interaction

- Use non-clickable teasers when their target should be conveyed over a CTA or a text link.
- Avoid grouping clickable and non-clickable items together, as this can negatively affect user expectations.

### Background

- Use light background options like white, neutral-100, primary-100, or use a primary background when inverted.

## Accessibility Information

- Include descriptive alt text or captions for images or video in the media slot, ensuring that non-text content is accessible. If the media is purely decorative, place an empty alt text.
- Adopt a consistent, semantically correct heading hierarchy to enable quick scanning across multiple teasers on a page. Teaser headings should be the first item in the DOM, introducing a new thematic region and separating the following content from the previous region.
- Ensure that each link target –especially clickable teasers that lack a dedicated action button or link element– clarifies its destination or function for screen readers.
