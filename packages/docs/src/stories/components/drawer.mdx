#### Related Templates

[Drawer](./?path=/docs/templates-drawer--docs)

### Common Use Cases

- Display supplementary information or options without navigating away from the main screen.
- Provide contextual help or guidance related to the current screen.
- House navigation menus on smaller devices.
- Present filter options, forms or settings that users can interact with without losing their place.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Slots

- Use the ”header” slot to add navigation and/or action elements if desired.
- Use the ”default” slot to add main content. The “default” slot is always scrollable. For simplicity, sd-scrollable is integrated into the component as a wrapper for the slot in Figma, but will need to be used in code if desired.
- Use the ”footer” slot to add action elements if desired. The “footer” slot is always fixed.

#### Content

- Ensure the content is supplementary and does not include critical information that users must see immediately such as notifications or alerts; instead, use [sd-notification](./?path=/docs/components-sd-notification--docs) or [sd-dialog](./?path=/docs/components-sd-dialog--docs) for those purposes.
- Check that the drawer content is fully visible and readable, even at larger font sizes.

#### Interaction and Behavior

- Maintain the state of the content when it is reopened.
- Avoid opening automatically without user interaction.
- Provide multiple ways to close the interface for easy dismissal, such as a close button or clicking outside of it.

#### Layout

- Ensure it does not cover critical content or actions on the main screen.
- If using a tertiary action in the header, adjust the left padding to 0px for proper alignment.

### Accessibility Information

- Always provide a label for the drawer so that screenreaders correctly announce the component.
- Make sure that the close button is always visible to ensure users are able to close the drawer.
