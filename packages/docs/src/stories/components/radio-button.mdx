### Common Use Cases

- Select one option from a group where one is already preselected.
- Switch between groups of settings.
- Filter views by a parent category.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Content

- Include icons to support each option visually if possible.
- Label each choice clearly.

#### Behavior

- Don’t use as input method in forms, for they are not form elements. Use [sd-radio](./?path=/docs/components-sd-radio--docs) instead.
- Slot inside of an [sd-radio-group](./?path=/docs/components-sd-radio-group--docs).
- Use only in groups, as they are designed to allow the user to activate one of several options. To work with a single option, use [sd-checkbox](./?path=/docs/components-sd-checkbox--docs) instead.
- Pre-select always a “default” value; there is no invalid state.
- Limit the number of options in the group. Users should be able to retain all options available and not be overwhelmed by them.

#### Styling

- All radio buttons in the group must be styled similarly, e.g., each one is labelled with both text and icon.
- Avoid styling options only with icons if they are not common symbols, to prevent ambiguous interpretations.

#### Background

- Use with light background options such as white, neutral-100, or primary-100.

### Accessibility Information

- Provide meaningful alternative text for icon-only radio buttons.
- Communicate the group’s function—such as filtering or view switching—through clear context or labels.
- Use the "visually disabled" attribute to keep disabled elements focusable, hoverable, and able to show tooltips, as they’re otherwise removed from the tab order and inaccessible to screen readers.
