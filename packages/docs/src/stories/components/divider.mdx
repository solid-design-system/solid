# Divider

Used to separate content or sections from each other and make the content easier to read for the user.

<DefaultStory />

<DocumentationLinks links=${JSON.stringify(links, null, 2)} />

### Common Use Cases

- Separate distinct item groups to help users clearly see and understand how different pieces of content relate to one another.
- Provide visual breaks in long pages or forms to improve readability.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Spacing and Consistency

- Maintain consistent spacing around separators to prevent them from appearing cramped or too distant from the content they divide.
- Ensure consistent use to prevent confusion, especially for users relying on assistive technologies.

#### Whitespace vs. Visual Separators

- Leverage whitespace effectively as a natural divider, which can offer a clean, easy to read and organised design without additional visual elements.

#### Background

- Use light background options like white, neutral-100 or primary-100.

### Accessibility Information

- Dividers should not interfere with keyboard navigation, allowing users to move through content seamlessly.
- Verify that dividers are visible and distinct in high contrast mode settings, which are often used by users with visual impairments.
- Use the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> HTML element for horizontal dividers to ensure they are recognized by assistive technologies. This helps screen readers announce the presence of a divider, providing context to users. For complex layouts, consider adding aria-labels or aria-describedby attributes to provide additional context about the sections being divided.
