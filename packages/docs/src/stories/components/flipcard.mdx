### Common Use Cases

- Present brief, essential information on the front with additional details on the back.
- Highlight key features or benefits of a product or service.
- Display before-and-after comparisons.
- Showcase testimonials or quotes with more context on the flip side.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Content

- Keep the front side simple and engaging to encourage users to flip the card.
- Do not use for critical information that needs to be immediately visible.
- Use with image, text or both content types.
- Keep alignment consistent on both sides, i.e. if you have top-aligned content on the front side, the content on the flip side should also be top aligned.

#### Interaction

- Avoid having different action items on both sides of the card to keep it simple for the user.

#### Context of Use

- Avoid using in contexts where users might not understand the flipping interaction.
- Avoid using in time-sensitive environments.

### Accessibility Information

- Keep the flip button to make sure the flipping can be activated over keyboard navigation over the Enter or Space keys.
- Keep the flip button to make sure the flipping can be activated by tabbing.
- Use ARIA roles such as aria-hidden to manage the visibility of the front and back sides. Ensure each side has a clear and descriptive label.
- Flipcards should avoid including interactive elements, and the focus would always stay on the flip-trigger after activating it. If the back side contains an interactive element, ensure focus moves to it after triggering the flip. When flipped back, focus should return to the flip trigger.
