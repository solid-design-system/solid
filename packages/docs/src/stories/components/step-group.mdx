### Common Use Cases

- Break complex data input tasks, such as filling out forms, into smaller, manageable steps to reduce cognitive strain and improve the user experience.
- Guide users through workflows that require completion of tasks in a specific order.
- Divide surveys or questionnaires into steps to make navigation, review, and completion easier and more intuitive.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Content

- Ensure each section has a clear and concise label that describes the task or content.
- Keep each section manageable; avoid overloading it with too much information or too many tasks.

#### User Guidance

- Make it clear to users that they are navigating a multistep process.
- Indicate the userâ€™s current position and provide feedback on completed steps to help track progress.
- Provide clear error messages and guidance if users need to correct information before proceeding.

#### Navigation

- Arrange sections in a logical, sequential order to guide users, commonly from left to right.
- Maintain consistent navigation for all steps to avoid user errors; include an option to return to previous steps.
- Prevent users from skipping sections unless it is absolutely necessary and clearly indicated.

#### Layout and Responsiveness

- Use a consistent layout design across all steps to ensure a cohesive experience.
- Use vertical or horizontal orientations, depending on what suits the process and viewport best.
- Be aware that choosing a horizontal layout may cause layout issues, such as overflow on small viewports or when the page is zoomed in; consider this when deciding between horizontal and vertical layouts.

#### Background

- Use light background options such as white, neutral-100, or primary-100.
