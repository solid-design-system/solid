### Common Use Cases

- Revealing additional content, such as a detailed description, specifications, or additional options without overwhelming the user with too much content at once.
- Interactive elements like a single FAQ item, where the user can expand to see the answer.
- Useful in forms to hide optional sections that the user can expand if needed, keeping the form clean and concise.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Slots

- Use the ”summary” slot to add text to the header.
- Use the ”default” slot to add content.

#### Header Summary

- Make sure the header summary clearly describes the content inside.
- Keep header summaries concise to prevent them from wrapping onto multiple lines.

#### Content

- Ensure the content is focused and necessary. If the information can be splitted into different meaningful units, consider using [sd-accordion-group](/?path=/docs/components-sd-accordion-group--docs).
- Avoid using collapsible sections for information that must always be visible.

#### Expandable vs. Accordion

- The use of sd-accordion is generally recommended over the use of [sd-expandable](/?path=/docs/components-sd-expandable--docs): the former gives the user a quick scan header to decide if the content is relevant to them, offers a cleaner layout and is more accessible as a result.

#### Background

- Use light background options like white, neutral-100 or primary-100.

### Accessibility Information

- Use only for non-critical information. Hiding content can become a potential barrier, making content more challenging to discover.
