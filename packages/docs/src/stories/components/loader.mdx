# Loader

Used as a visual indicator with a looping animation that shows loading is in process.

<DefaultStory />

<DocumentationLinks links=${JSON.stringify(links, null, 2)} />

### Common Use Cases

- Indicate that content is being loaded, such as when fetching data from a server or loading a new page.
- Show ongoing background processes, like file uploads or data processing tasks.
- Used within buttons or interactive elements to indicate that an action is being processed.
- Apply to sections of a page that are loading independently, such as widgets or panels.
- Display when a form is being submitted to show that the submission is in progress.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Content

- Include a label or message to provide context about what is being loaded, especially if the loading time is long.

#### Behavior and Placement

- Use for processes that take a short amount of time (typically under 4 seconds).
- Apply within specific sections rather than blocking the entire page, unless absolutely necessary.
- Place in a consistent location relative to the content it is loading.

#### Styling

- Maintain consistency in size and style; avoid using loaders of varying sizes on the same page.

#### Background

- Use light background options like white, neutral-100, primary-100, or use a primary background when inverted.

### Accessibility Information

- Assign role="status" or use a live region (e.g., aria-live="polite") to inform screen reader users of ongoing loading.
- A loader shouldnâ€™t itself be focusable or interactive, nor prevent from navigating to other parts of the page while loading continues.
