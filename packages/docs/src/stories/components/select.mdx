### Common Use Cases

- Enable users to select one or more options from a list of predefined choices in forms.
- Implement in filter panels to allow users to refine search results or data views.
- Provide options in settings pages where users need to choose preferences from a list.

#### Default Select

Use the “default” variant when clarity, scannability, and accessibility are your primary concerns.

- Long or descriptive labels, helper text, or units are needed.
- Forms with many fields that users must scan quickly.
- Complex fields with adornments, counters, or tooltips.

#### Floating Label Select

Use the “floating-label” variant to conserve vertical space and streamline simple forms, while still keeping the label visible.

- Compact layouts and simple fields.
- Short labels (1–3 words); minimal helper text.
- You want a clean look without duplicate placeholder text.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Variant Consistency

Do not mix the two variants (default / floating label) within the same product, flow or form. Read the use cases above to know when to use each type.

#### Content and Labels

- Keep each option to a single line of text for readability.
- Ensure all options have consistent line lengths for easier scanning.
- Avoid using the same word or phrase at the beginning of options.
- Provide a meaningful placeholder option to guide users.

#### Selection Behavior

- Use for lists with more than five options; for fewer options, consider using sd-radio for single selection or [sd-checkbox](./?path=/docs/components-sd-checkbox--docs) for multiple selection.
- Apply the "multiple" attribute when multiple selections are allowed, and pair it with "checkbox" for corresponding nested options.
- By default, the number of selected options is displayed after the text.
- Display selected options as tags within the field to help users track their selections.

#### Background

- Use light background options such as white, neutral-100, or primary-100.

### Accessibility Information

- If multiple options can be selected, clearly announce this capability to screenreader users and offer a way to view all chosen items.
- Be aware that group labels in select components will be neglected by most assistive devices.
- Use the "visually disabled" attribute to keep disabled elements focusable, hoverable, and able to show tooltips, as they’re otherwise removed from the tab order and inaccessible to screen readers.
