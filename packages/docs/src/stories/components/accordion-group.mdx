The following sections cover the use of the group component. See <sd-link href="https://www.figma.com/design/YDktJcseQIIQbsuCpoKS4V/Component-Docs?node-id=2001-2283&t=CRApplu7KVvCKHLb-0">sd-accordion</sd-link> for standalone usage guidelines.

## Common Use Cases

- Organise content into collapsible sections to save space.
- Display FAQs where each question can be expanded to reveal its answer.
- Structure lengthy content into manageable expandable sections.
- Create navigational menus where each section can be expanded to show sub-items, mainly for small viewports.

## Usage Guidelines

### Slots

- Use the ”summary” slot to add text to the header.
- Use the ”default” slot to add content.

### Content

- Ensure the content is relevant and necessary; avoid including unrelated information.
- Avoid using collapsible sections for content that needs to be always visible or is critical for immediate user attention.

### Header Summary

- Make sure the header summary clearly describes the content inside.
- Keep header summaries concise to prevent them from wrapping onto multiple lines.

### Behaviour

- Keep only one section open at a time to prevent information overload, unless multiple open sections are necessary.
- Avoid nesting collapsible sections within each other to prevent a confusing user experience.

### Expandable vs. Accordion

- The use of sd-accordion is generally recommended over the use of sd-expandable: the former gives the user a quick scan header to decide if the content is relevant to them, offers a cleaner layout and is more accessible as a result.

### Background

- Use light background options such as white, neutral-100, or primary-100.

## Accessibility Information

- Use only for non-critical information. Hiding content can become a potential barrier, making it more challenging for users to access information.
- Ensure that users can navigate through the accordion headers using the keyboard (e.g., Tab and Enter keys).
- Use appropriate ARIA roles, such as ”aria-expanded” to indicate the state of the accordion sections or ”aria-live” regions to announce dynamic changes in the accordion content to screen reader users.
- Use “close-others” attribute to keep only one item from the group open at a time, reducing the amount of information displayed at once and therefore reducing the cognitive load on the user.
