#### Related Templates

### Common Use Cases

- Organise content into collapsible sections to save space.
- Display FAQs where each question can be expanded to reveal its answer.
- Structure lengthy content into manageable expandable sections.
- Create navigational menus where each section can be expanded to show sub-items, mainly for small viewports.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Slots

- Use the ”summary” slot to add text to the header.
- Use the ”default” slot to add content.

#### Content

- Ensure the content is relevant and necessary; avoid including unrelated information.
- Avoid using collapsible sections for content that needs to be always visible or is critical for immediate user attention.

#### Header Summary

- Make sure the header summary clearly describes the content inside.
- Keep header summaries concise to prevent them from wrapping onto multiple lines.

#### Behaviour

- Keep only one section open at a time to prevent information overload, unless multiple open sections are necessary.
- Avoid nesting collapsible sections within each other to prevent a confusing user experience.

#### Expandable vs. Accordion

- The use of [sd-accordion](/?path=/docs/components-sd-accordion--docs) is generally recommended over the use of [sd-expandable](/?path=/docs/components-sd-expandable--docs): the former gives the user a quick scan header to decide if the content is relevant to them, offers a cleaner layout and is more accessible as a result.

#### Background

- Use light background options such as white, neutral-100, or primary-100.

### Accessibility Information

- Use only for non-critical information. Hiding content can become a potential barrier, making it more challenging for users to access information.
- Ensure that users can navigate through the accordion headers using the keyboard (e.g., Tab and Enter keys).
- Use appropriate ARIA roles, such as ”aria-expanded” to indicate the state of the accordion sections or ”aria-live” regions to announce dynamic changes in the accordion content to screen reader users.
- Use “close-others” attribute to keep only one item from the group open at a time, reducing the amount of information displayed at once and therefore reducing the cognitive load on the user.
- For purely decorative images, ALT-tags should be left empty so that screen readers can bypass them and concentrate on conveying meaningful content.
