[Link](./?path=/docs/templates-link--docs)

### Common Use Cases

- Navigate to other pages or sections within the same page.
- Link to external websites or resources, such as file downloads.
- Include links within text blocks for references or citations.
- Link to emails or phone numbers.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Link Text and Label

- Be specific and use descriptive and concise link text that indicates the destination or action. For example, instead of "Click here for more information", use "Learn more about our services".
- Avoid generic phrases like "Click here".
- Display system icons before or after the link label when an action is actively executed as a result, such as opening a new window.

#### Behavior and Interaction

- Do not use links for actions that should be performed by buttons (e.g., submitting forms, triggering modals).
- Do not open links in new tabs without informing the user.
- Avoid placing too many links close together to make sure they’re easy to click or tap.

#### Backgrounds

- Use light background options like white, neutral-100, primary-100, or use a primary background when inverted.

### Accessibility Information

- Use descriptive link text that clearly conveys its purpose to screen reader users out of context.
- Avoid having multiple links that point to the same URL within the same context, as this can be confusing for users.
- Use the "visually disabled" attribute to keep disabled elements focusable, hoverable, and able to show tooltips, as they’re otherwise removed from the tab order and inaccessible to screen readers.
