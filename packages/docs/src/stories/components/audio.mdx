- Embed instructional audio to guide users through complex processes or tutorials.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Behavior

- Avoid autoplaying audio as it can be disruptive.
- Provide controls to allow users to play and pause.
- Use appropriate formats and sizes to optimize loading times and performance.

#### Background

- Use light background options like white, neutral-100, primary-100, or use a primary background when inverted.

### Accessibility Information

- Provide audio descriptions to ensure all users can access the content.
- Ensure all player controls (play, pause, volume, speed, etc.) are fully operable using only the keyboard.
- Include an audio transcript to support users who are deaf, hard of hearing, or prefer reading at their own pace.
- For purely decorative images, ALT-tags should be left empty so that screen readers can bypass them and concentrate on conveying meaningful content.
