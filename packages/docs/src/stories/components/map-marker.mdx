### Common Use Cases

- Indicate individual locations on a map, such as offices, venues, or other points of interest.
- Group individual locations into clusters at higher zoom levels, displaying the number of locations in the cluster.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Styling and Icons

- Use logos or icons for place pins that can be easily identified.
- Avoid using overly complex logos or icons that might confuse users.
- Limit the variety of icons to prevent confusion about the meaning of markers.

#### Behavior and Interaction

- Keep the main marker for the current or preset location visible at all times.
- Ensure that only one main marker is active at any given moment.
- Use clustering for high-density areas to enhance map readability.
- Regularly update the marker data to reflect current information.

### Accessibility Information

- If interactive, provide an accessible name by adding a descriptive text to the ”default” slot and visually hide it if needed.
- Offer alternative interactions or text-based listings of markers for users who cannot easily manipulate or see the map.
- For purely decorative images, ALT-tags should be left empty so that screen readers can bypass them and concentrate on conveying meaningful content.
