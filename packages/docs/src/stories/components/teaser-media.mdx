### Common Use Cases

- Drive traffic to forms or services by providing short summaries and supportive imagery.
- Highlight special offers or promotions with clear calls to action.
- Promote upcoming events or webinars with engaging visuals, dates, and sign-up links.
- Feature downloadable resources like e-books or whitepapers.
- Showcase success stories, case studies, or team member profiles to build trust and credibility.
- Offer quick previews of blog posts, news articles, or videos, encouraging users to explore further.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Content

- Use brief, impactful headings to convey the message quickly; the main content should complement the corresponding heading.
- Ensure that the information in each item is independent from others around it; avoid cross-referencing items placed close together.

#### Media

- Make sure images are high quality, clear, and relevant to the content; optimize performance by compressing them and implementing lazy loading.
- Remember to include copyright information whenever necessary.
- Avoid placing visual information at the bottom of the image, as it may be covered by text overlays.

#### Behaviour

- Avoid adding action elements to the expandable slot content, as these actions are not accessible to all users; only those using a mouse can interact with them.

#### Styling

- Adjust paddings and layouts as needed to ensure content is visible and accessible.

#### Background

- Use light background options like white, neutral-100, primary-100, or use a primary background when inverted.

### Accessibility Information

- Adopt a consistent, semantically correct heading hierarchy to enable quick scanning across multiple teasers on a page. Teaser headings should be the first item in the DOM, introducing a new thematic region and separating the following content from the previous region.
- Include descriptive alt text for the media slot, ensuring that non-text content is accessible.
- For purely decorative images, ALT-tags should be left empty so that screen readers can bypass them and concentrate on conveying meaningful content.
- Avoid placing essential information or actions in expandable teaser areas since they are visible on mouse hover.
- Verify that each link is announced in a way that conveys its unique destination or function to screen readers.
- Ensure that the background images you choose for each teaser variant provide enough contrast with the text to maintain readability.
