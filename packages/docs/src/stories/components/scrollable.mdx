## Common Use Cases

- Present long lists or detailed information that exceeds the visible area.

## Usage Guidelines

### Content

- Ensure critical information is not hidden within scrollable areas; users should not have to scroll to find essential content.

### Behavior

- Use visual cues like shadows or buttons to indicate scrollable content when simply cutting off hidden content isn't enough.
- Avoid disabling scrollbars, as they provide essential visual cues for users.
- Limit the use of scrollable containers; excessive scrolling can be frustrating for users.
- Prefer vertical scrolling over horizontal scrolling, especially on mobile devices.

### Responsiveness

- Test whether your scrollable containers adapts well to different screen sizes and orientations.
- Avoid setting fixed heights for scrollable containers if the content size can vary significantly.

## Accessibility Information

- Ensure keyboard users can access and scroll within the container making the container focusable (tabindex="0") and allow arrow keys to navigate through the content.
- Verify that any interactive elements within the scrollable container receive a proper focus highlight and move into the visible frame.
