### Common Use Cases

- Allow users to select one or more options from a potentially large list by typing a search string and filtering suggestions.
- Provide an autocomplete feature in forms where specific or complex entries benefit from quick lookup.
- Implement in search fields or filter panels when users may not recall the exact option name but can approximate it.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Content and Labels

- Keep option labels concise so that suggestions are easy to scan and select.
- Provide a clear, descriptive placeholder (e.g., “Search or select an option…”) to help users understand they can type and choose from suggestions.
- Avoid repeating the same initial word in multiple suggestions to reduce scanning difficulty.

#### Searching Behavior

- Filter available options in real time as the user types; highlight or bold matching text to indicate relevance.
- Show a message (e.g., “No matches found”) when no options align with the user’s input.
- Consider limiting the maximum number of displayed suggestions to avoid overwhelming users.

#### Background

- Use light backgrounds such as white, neutral-100, or primary-100 for clarity and consistency across different layouts.
- Keep focus styles clearly visible when the user navigates through suggestions with a keyboard or screen reader.

### Accessibility Information

- To ensure screenreader compatibility, consider including a statement such as "Fields marked with an asterisk (\*) are required" at the start of the form.
- A visible label may be omitted for search input fields within a combobox if an associated button—complete with a clear search icon and an appropriate accessible name (e.g., aria-label="Search")—is provided.
- Be aware that group labels will be neglected by most assistive devices.
- Use the "visually disabled" attribute to keep disabled elements focusable, hoverable, and able to show tooltips, as they’re otherwise removed from the tab order and inaccessible to screen readers.
