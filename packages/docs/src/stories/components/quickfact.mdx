### Common Use Cases

- Highlight important statistics or facts within a page to draw attention.
- Summarize complex data into digestible pieces of information.
- Emphasize critical points or findings alongside articles or reports.
- Showcase key benefits or features of a product in promotional materials.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Content

- Focus on one key piece of information per quick fact.
- Ensure each quick fact can be understood independently, even when part of a group.
- Avoid using in contexts where detailed explanations are required.

#### Behavior

- Use the expandable attribute for supplementary information that isn’t essential for initial understanding.
- Limit the number of quick facts on a single page to avoid overwhelming users.
- Include a single quick fact when needed, even though they are typically presented in groups.

#### Icon and Responsiveness

- Make sure the chosen content icon logically illustrates the key fact you want to communicate.
- Adapt the style according to screen size (e.g., ≤ 414px width for mobile screens) to maintain responsiveness.

#### Background

- Use light background options such as white, neutral-100, or primary-100.

### Accessibility Information

- Ensure that the summaries are short, concise and unique as they’re used as the label for the button.
