# Button

Used to allow users to perform actions with a single click.

Buttons perform various functions (e.g. download, link) or activate other functions (e.g. filter). All buttons can be displayed with or without an icon.

### Common Use Cases

- Highlight key actions, like "Request information" or "Next step".
- Provide supporting actions, like "Learn more", "Explore topic", or "Cancel".
- Use for functional actions after user input, such as submitting a form or searching for content.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Function

- Use to trigger an action or place a link inside it to navigate to other content.

#### Action Labels

- Write simple, self-explanatory labels that include both a verb (action) and a noun.
- Use text-only labels whenever possible.
- Avoid generic labels like "OK" or “Download”. Use “Confirm selection” or “Download Report” instead.
- Limit action labels to 1 to 3 words or 15 to 20 characters.

#### Action Priority

- Select the appropriate variant for each action based on context and importance.
- Avoid displaying more than one Call To Action (CTA) at a time on the screen, especially in the same context (e.g., teaser).

#### Icons

- Add icons to labels only when they clearly support the associated action (e.g., print, email, share), and reserve icon-only buttons for exceptions.
- Avoid displaying both left and right icons simultaneously.

#### Placement and Responsiveness

- Maintain consistent placement of interactive elements throughout the user interface.
- Position the primary action at the top (in vertical layout) or on the right (in horizontal layout) when paired with a secondary option.
- Avoid placing two primary actions next to each other; opt for a secondary action instead.
- Expand to full width on small devices if applicable.

#### Background

- Use light background options like white, neutral-100, primary-100, or use a primary background when inverted.

### Accessibility Information

- Ensure that button text is unique and contextual. Screen readers will read it aloud, helping users understand the action associated with the button.
- Keep button text short. Longer copy is harder to scan and increases cognitive load. Remember that translations may double the length of the text.
- Be aware that button’s height may change based on the user’s preferred font size set system-wide.
- For icon-only: Include an ARIA label describing its function (e.g., “Expand section”) to ensure the button is accessible to screen readers.
- Prefer keeping the button enabled by default by relying on default values or by validating on submit.
- Use the "visually disabled" attribute to keep disabled elements focusable, hoverable, and able to show tooltips, as they’re otherwise removed from the tab order and inaccessible to screen readers.
