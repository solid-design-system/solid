Used to allow users to perform actions with a single click.

### Common Use Cases

- Highlight key actions, like "Request information" or "Next step".
- Provide supporting actions, like "Learn more", "Explore topic", or "Cancel".
- Use for functional actions after user input, such as submitting a form or searching for content.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Function

- Use to trigger an action or place a link inside it to navigate to other content.

#### Action Labels

- Write simple, self-explanatory labels that include both a verb (action) and a noun.
- Use text-only labels whenever possible.
- Avoid generic labels like "OK" or “Download”. Use “Confirm selection” or “Download Report” instead.
- Limit action labels to 1 to 3 words or 15 to 20 characters.

#### Action Priority

- Select the appropriate variant for each action based on context and importance.
- Avoid displaying more than one Call To Action (CTA) at a time on the screen, especially in the same context (e.g., teaser).

#### Icons

- Add icons to labels only when they clearly support the associated action (e.g., print, email, share), and reserve icon-only buttons for exceptions.
- Avoid displaying both left and right icons simultaneously.

#### Placement and Responsiveness

- Maintain consistent placement of interactive elements throughout the user interface.
- Position the primary action at the top (in vertical layout) or on the right (in horizontal layout) when paired with a secondary option.
- Avoid placing two primary actions next to each other; opt for a secondary action instead.
- Expand to full width on small devices if applicable.

#### Background

- Use light background options like white, neutral-100, primary-100, or use a primary background when inverted.

### Accessibility Information

- Ensure the button title is contextual. Screen readers will read it aloud, helping users understand the action associated with the button.
- Keep button text short. Longer copy is harder to scan and increases cognitive load. Remember that translations may double the length of the text.
- Provide always an ARIA label for icon-only buttons.
- Avoid disabled buttons. If needed, ensure that they remain in the regular tab order but cannot be activated, allowing screen readers to announce their state and purpose. Use the native disabled attribute or appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-disabled="true").
- Be aware that button’s height may change based on the user’s preferred font size set system-wide.
