# Header

Used as a container for the main navigation of a website.

### Common Use Cases

- Display primary navigation links for easy access to different sections of the website.
- Showcase the company logo prominently to reinforce brand identity.
- Include links for user account access.
- Provide a prominent search function to help users quickly find content.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Navigation Structure and Content

- Include the logo, main navigation, and, if applicable, sub-brand logos and meta navigation.
- Use the number of navigation items that best suits the content, always ensuring categories are clearly labeled and mutually exclusive.
- Regularly update the navigation links to reflect current content and structure.

#### Layout

- Place navigation items to the left, the logo at the top left, and meta navigation on the right in wider viewports to keep consistency across products.
- In smaller viewports, place an expandable menu on the right to host navigation items while keeping the logo consistently on the left across all viewport sizes.
- Keep the navigation fixed at the top of the website when scrolling back to the top.

#### Visual Style and Branding

- Provide clear visual indicators for active or selected navigation items.
- Refrain from customizing elements in ways that deviate from the brand identity.
- Include the company logo prominently; do not use a header without the corresponding logo.

### Accessibility Information

- Refrain from injecting non-navigation or unrelated content (like dynamic elements) into the header container to avoid distracting or confusing assistive technology.
- Provide a unique ID on the header container for skip links, ensuring keyboard users can quickly bypass navigation if desired.
- When placing a logo in the header, describe its target (e.g., “Union Investment Homepage”), not the image (e.g., "Union Investment Logo").
