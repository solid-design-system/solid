# Switch

Used to give control over a feature or option that can be turned on or off.

<DefaultStory />

<DocumentationLinks storybookLink="${storybookLink}" figmaLibrary="${figmaLibrary}" figmaDocs="${figmaDocs}" />

## Common Use Cases

- Allow users to switch between two states.
- Use to enable or disable settings, such as turning notifications on or off.
- Toggle features or functionalities within an application, applying changes immediately.

## Usage Guidelines

### Content

- Make sure both the label and action are clear by using appropriate text.
- Place label text on top of the control, such as in a header, while action text should be placed to the right, next to the control.
- Use adjectives to describe actions, as they are less ambiguous than verbs.
- Limit use to binary choices, such as "on/off" or "yes/no."

### Behavior

- Use for actions that take effect immediately without requiring additional confirmation.
- Ensure the visual state accurately reflects its functional state.
- If it's unclear whether the component is showing a state or an action, use [sd-checkbox](?path=/docs/components-sd-checkbox--docs) instead.

## Accessibility Information

- Consider alternatives to switches, as many users may find them confusing.
- Include aria-checked="true" or aria-checked="false" to indicate the on/off state to assistive technologies.
- Ensure screenreaders announce the label text when focusing a switch.
- If the switch triggers dynamic changes (e.g., loading new content), provide a corresponding announcement.
