### Common Use Cases

- Represent the loading state of specific UI elements like titles, images, and body content on detailed pages.

- Show placeholders for repeating elements such as items in a product grid or a list of search results.

### Usage Guidelines

**Content and Styling**

- Ensure skeleton screens closely resemble the layout of the final content to provide a smooth transition once the content is loaded.
- Use a consistent skeleton style across similar components for uniformity.
- Make skeletons non-interactive placeholders, not functional components.

**Behavior and Interaction**

- Use skeletons only for content that takes longer than one second to load, avoiding quick flashes.
- Avoid showing skeletons for elements that aren't actually loading, as this can confuse or mislead users.
- Do not rely solely on skeletons for loading feedback; consider providing text like "Loading" for better accessibility.
- Provide smooth, subtle transitions from the skeleton to the loaded content.

**Performance**

- Ensure skeletons are lightweight to avoid overloading the page with complex or animated elements that can affect performance.

### Accessibility Information

- Use aria-hidden="true" on skeleton placeholders so screenreaders skip them.
- Provide a meaningful status update while skeletons are visible (e.g., “Loading…” or a live region announcing updates) to inform assistive technology users that content is still being retrieved.
