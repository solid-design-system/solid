## Principles

Solid Components are part of the Solid Design System, serving as a robust foundation for Union Investment's digital presence, built upon three core principles:

1. **Usable & consistent**
2. **Reusable & flexible**
3. **Maintainable & reliable**

### Usable & consistent

Our mission is to reflect the Union Investment brand in a consistent and accessible manner. Our strategies include:

- **Design System**: As part of the Solid Design System, Solid Components align with our brand guidelines.
- **Synced Design Tokens**: Ensuring uniform style and layout across components and fostering a common language between development and design.
- **Accessibility Standards**: Commitment to accessibility standards for all users.
- **Clear Guidelines**: Offering instructions for appropriate usage and arrangement of components.

Recognizing that not all scenarios can be pre-designed, we focus on building a core of consistent and adaptable components.

### Reusable & flexible

Solid Components are designed to be adaptable and reusable across different projects:

- **Generalizability in view**: Components are crafted framework-agnostic with maximum generalizability and minimum required properties, enabling their usage across varied contexts.
- **Equivalent cooperation**: Components are designed for easy integration into different projects, seamlessly functioning with other systems.

Rather than catering to specific project needs, we aim to create versatile components applicable to a broad range of situations, enhancing their long-term value.

### Maintainable & reliable

Solid Components are designed to offer high reliability and easy maintainability:

- **"Dumber", declarative components**: Components free of business logic for easier updates.
- **Cautious feature implementation**: New features are carefully evaluated for their impact on reliability and maintainability.
- **Responsibility delegation to the application**: Lightweight components allowing for customization and greater flexibility.
- **Thorough testing**: High test coverage with E2E-Tests via Playwright (<a href={`https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v${playwrightVersion}`} target="\_blank">tested Browser versions</a>) and Visual Regression Tests via Chromatic ([current Browser versions](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/infrastructure-release-notes)).

Our emphasis is on creating a solid foundation of reliable, maintainable components that balance necessary features with ease of upkeep.

## Structure

- **Components**: A comprehensive set of Figma Design and Web Components offers a seamless user experience and extensive customization options for various design needs and project goals. These components go beyond simple styles: they are often more complex, featuring reactivity, state management, multiple slots, configurable properties, and more.
- **Styles**: CSS styles can be utilized both in code and as design elements within Figma. They are usually independent, non-interactive files that specify the visual aspects of elements—like color, typography, and spacing—without incorporating any functional logic.
- **Templates**: Reusable design blocks and comprehensive templates offer complete, use-case-specific designs that provide a strong foundation for cohesive and efficient application design.
