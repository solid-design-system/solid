# Known Browser Issues

We've identified several browser issues that may affect visual consistency while using Solid Components.
It's important for developers to be aware of these issues when implementing our components.

## Blurry Placeholder Images in Chrome

In Chrome, our placeholder images may appear blurry at times. This is not a package issue but Chrome-specific behavior.

## Wobbly Spinner in Safari

The 'sd-spinner' component may experience spinner animation issues in Safari, causing them to appear wobbly.

## Footnotes in Safari

When clicking on a `sd-footnotes` reference, a `sd-footnotes--marker` is highlighted. In Safari it also applies the
`focus-visible` outline, due to browser behaviour.

When using keyboard navigation on Safari v17 or lower, `sd-footnotes--marker` inside `sd-footnotes` are unreachable due to absolute position.

While acknowledging browser-specific issues, we opted not to include complex workarounds in Solid Components.
This approach maintains code simplicity, making it easier for developers to work with our library while keeping it adaptable to evolving browser standards.
