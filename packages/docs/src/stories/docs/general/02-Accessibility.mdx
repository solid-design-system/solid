# Accessibility at Union Investment

Union Investment strives to offer digital products and services that are accessible to everyone, regardless of ability or the technology they use. As a financial service provider, ensuring accessibility is even more critical.

Accessibility is an ongoing priority for us. We are continuously enhancing our accessibility efforts to meet, at a minimum, the WCAG 2.2 Level AA guidelines. In addition, we are preparing for the Barrier-Free Accessibility Strengthening Act, which will come into force in 2025.

## Why WCAG 2.2 Level AA Is Important

- Inclusion and Equity: By achieving Level AA standards, you make your digital content accessible to people with a wide range of disabilities, promoting inclusivity and equal access to information. This is not only an ethical obligation but also a way to foster equity in the digital landscape.
- Why Prioritize Accessibility?: Prioritizing accessibility allows you to reach a broader audience, comply with regulations, uphold ethical standards, and enhance usability for all users. Accessible design improves user experience universally, benefitting everyone, regardless of their abilities.
- Legal Compliance: In many countries, including Germany and across the European Union, WCAG guidelines have been adopted as part of accessibility laws. In Germany, the Barrierefreie-Informationstechnik-Verordnung (BITV), which aligns with WCAG standards, mandates compliance with Level AA for public sector websites and strongly encourages it for private sector websites. Meeting these requirements ensures that your website adheres to both national and EU-level regulations.

## Include everybody

In many cases, features designed for accessibility benefit everyone. Enhancements like improved user-friendliness, better overall user experience, and support for foreign language speakers can make digital products easier and more enjoyable for all users.

Web accessibility includes all disabilities that can impact a user's ability to access and navigate the internet:

**Permanent:**

- auditory impairments (e.g., deafness, partial hearing loss, difficulty understanding spoken language)
- cognitive impairments (e.g., learning disabilities, memory or attention challenges)
- neurological impairments (e.g., brain injuries, conditions affecting processing speed or focus)
- physical impairments (e.g., limited mobility, motor control difficulties)
- speech impairments (e.g., difficulty with speech production or communication)
- visual impairments (e.g., blindness, low vision, color blindness)
- age-related impairments (e.g., vision or hearing decline, cognitive changes)

**Temporary:**

Barriers to accessibility are not always permanent. They can also be temporary—for instance, when someone has an eye infection or a cast on their hand.

**Situational:**

Situational barriers can occur too, such as trying to view a screen in bright light or watching a video on public transport without headphones.

## Best Practices for a WCAG Compliant Basis

<sd-notification variant="error" open>Product teams must ensure that their digital products built on Solid DS remain compliant with these standards.</sd-notification>

Implementing Solid components into your product is an important first step in making web applications accessible. However, accessibility goes beyond just using these components—it requires careful consideration of context, content order, and semantics. Each time a component is used, it's essential to understand its purpose and ensure it serves the correct, meaningful function in its context.

**Semantic Structure & HTML Usage**

- Semantically Correct Structure: Implement a clear, logical structure (e.g., H1 for the main heading, followed by H2, and P tags for paragraphs). This helps assistive technologies interpret the meaning and hierarchy of content correctly. It is crucial to create a semantically correct structure to ensure proper navigation and understanding by users with disabilities. Headline sizes and H-Tags are flexible and can be selected according to your preferences, rather than being restricted to specific combinations.
- Native HTML: Always prioritize native HTML elements over ARIA labels whenever possible. This practice ensures that our content is accessible to a wide range of assistive technologies, improving overall compatibility.

**Keyboard Controls & Screen Readers**

- Keyboard Accessibility: Ensure that all interactive elements are focusable with the keyboard, in the correct order, and with a visual focus indicator. This guarantees accessibility for users who rely on keyboard navigation.
- Screen Readers: Do not remove ARIA attributes from Solid examples. These attributes are vital for ensuring that screen readers can accurately interpret and relay content to users.

**Multimedia**

- Alt Text: Ensure that all images, icons, and non-text content have descriptive alternative text when they convey information, making the content accessible to users with visual impairments. For purely decorative images, leave the alt text empty. Be sure to distinguish between images that add informational value and those that are purely decorative, which do not require alt descriptions.
- Captions & Transcripts: Always include captions and transcripts for video and audio content.
- Control for Auto-play Media: Avoid auto-playing audio or video content. Always provide play/pause options so users can control their media experience.

**Color Accessibility**

- Color Contrast: Ensure that color contrast meets WCAG AA standards.
- Color Combinations: Test and adjust color combinations.
- Text Color Limitations: The accent color (green) is restricted to the following backgrounds: white, primary, primary-100, and neutral-100 on which green text must meet the minimum size requirement of 18.67px for bold and 24px for book. When inverted on a green background, only white or primary text colors are allowed. For text on a green background, white text must also meet the minimum size requirements of 18.67px for bold and 24px for book.

**Motion**

- Respect Reduced Motion Preferences: Include the prefers-reduced-motion media query in your CSS for all web content to accommodate users who prefer reduced motion.

**Responsiveness**

- Flexible Layouts: Design fluid layouts that adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and accessible experience across devices.
- Readable Text: Ensure text remains legible without the need for horizontal scrolling, regardless of screen size or device.
- Accessible Touch Targets: Make touch targets large enough to allow for easy and accurate interaction on touchscreen devices.
- Media Adaptation: Scale images and other media appropriately for different screen sizes, ensuring they are accessible and visually consistent on all devices.

## Accessibility Testing

- Accessibility audits: Conduct regular A11y audits to ensure WCAG compliance and identify and resolve potential barriers for users.
- Mouseless Testing: Ensure that all functionality is accessible without relying on mouse interactions by conducting mouseless tests.
- A11y Test Cases: Develop comprehensive accessibility test cases to validate conformance to accessibility standards.
- Focus Visibility & Order: Verify that the focus state is visible and the tab order for interactive elements is logical and consistent.

**Figma Accessibility Tools**

**Contrast:** The “[Contrast](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/748533339900865323/contrast?fuid=1263848586749601824)” plugin is a free and useful tool that allows you to check specific color combinations for compliance. It can also scan entire pages and evaluate text on transparent overlays over images, ensuring accessibility throughout your design.

**Include:** The "[Include](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1208180794570801545/include-accessibility-annotations?fuid=1263848586749601824)" plugin is a free tool that simplifies the creation of accessibility annotations (A11y), making it easier for designers to specify requirements and for developers to understand and implement them. It provides checks for essential accessibility features, such as contrast ratio (AA compliance), text resizing, vision simulation, and responsive reflow.

## What's next

We are committed to continuously improving the accessibility of our digital products, staying up to date with evolving guidelines and best practices.

In the following months will be developing accessibility best practices for each component, providing specific guidance on their proper usage to ensure consistency and inclusivity.
