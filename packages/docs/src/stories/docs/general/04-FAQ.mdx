      What is the story behind the "Design Tokens"?
    </h4>
    <span className="sd-prose">
      <p>Design tokens are like labels or tags that designers use to define things like colors, fonts, and sizes. Imagine a design token as a name given to a color, such as “Primary Blue,” so that whenever the design needs that blue, you just refer to the token instead of the specific color code.</p>
      <p>By using tokens, if the designer decides to change “Primary Blue” to a different shade, they only need to update it in one place, and the change will happen everywhere it's used. This makes it much easier to keep designs consistent without having to manually change the color in every spot.</p>

      What is the suggested workflow between Design and Dev in the project-specific teams?
    </h4>
    <span className="sd-prose">
      The Solid Design System Team does not impose strict rules on how design and development teams should operate. Instead, we offer guidance and best practices that promote collaboration, agility, and efficiency in integrating the design system into your workflow. The collaboration advice for consumers generally includes:

      - **Shared Language and Terminology:** Ensuring that both designers and developers refer to components, colors, or tokens using a unified language helps avoid confusion and miscommunication during implementation.
      - **Use of Agile Practices:** Consumers are encouraged to adopt agile workflows, such as frequent design and development sprints. This allows for continuous feedback and adjustments to ensure that both the design and development stay aligned​.
      - **Design Systems as a Source of Truth:** The design system should serve as the central repository for all reusable components, ensuring consistency across teams and reducing the need for repetitive design work​.
