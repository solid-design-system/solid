# Migration Guide: `ui-input`

As the CL component has been reduced a lot and split up into several SDS components, here you can find migration guides for:
`ui-input` to `sd-input`,
`ui-input` to `sd-radio`,
`ui-input` to `sd-switch` and
`ui-input` to `sd-checkbox`

# ui-input type="text" to sd-input

Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the new `sd-input` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## 💾 Slots

### ✨ New Slots

The input's label.

#### [left]

Used to prepend a presentational icon or similar element to the input.

#### [right]

#### [clear-icon]

An icon to use in lieu of the default clear icon.

#### [show-password-icon]
