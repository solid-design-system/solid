# Migration Guide: From `ui-scrollable` to `sd-scrollable`

The new `sd-scrollable` is designed to replace the `ui-scrollable`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-scrollable` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## 💾 Slots

### ✨ New Slots

#### [icon-start]

The scrollable's start icon.

#### [icon-end]

The scrollable's end icon.

<hr />

## ⚙️ Attributes

### ✨ New Attributes

#### [inset]

The `inset` attribute is used to set the inner padding of the scrollable.

### 🔀 Updated Attributes

#### [orientation]

Replaces `scroll-direction`. It still offers `horizontal`, `vertical` and `auto` values but the default is now `horizontal` instead of `auto`.

<hr />

## ✍️ CSS Variables

### ✨ New CSS Variables

#### [--gradient-color]

Defines a custom color for the gradient.

<hr />

## 🥳 Events

### ✨ New Events

#### [button-left]

Emitted when the left button is clicked.

#### [button-right]

Emitted when the right button is clicked.

#### [button-up]

Emitted when the top button is clicked.

#### [button-down]

Emitted when the bottom button is clicked.

#### [end]

Emitted when the end of the scrollable is reached.

#### [start]

Emitted when the start of the scrollable is reached.

<hr />

## 💪 Additional Changes

### [ui-scrollable-button]

### [ui-scrollable-shadow]

The functionality provided by these two components is now directly implemented inside the `sd-scrollable` component.
