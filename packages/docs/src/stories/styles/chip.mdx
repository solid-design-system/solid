- [Teaser with Chip and Flag](./?path=/docs/templates-teaser--docs#teaser-with-chip-and-flag)
- [Status Badge with Chip](./?path=/docs/templates-status-badge--docs)

### Common Use Cases

- Display selected items or categories within sd-teaser, such as chosen filters, tags, or interests.
- Indicate attributes of items, such as “New,” “Featured,” or “Verified”.
- Communicate user roles, like “Moderator” or “Admin”.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Label and Styling

- Keep chip text short and easily scannable. Long text disrupts layouts and diminishes the chip’s visual impact.
- Avoid overuse. Too many chips in one area can create visual clutter.
- Use the “&--variant” property to apply the color variant that best works on the background, keeping it consistent throughout the product.

#### Chips and Flags

- sd-chip and [sd-flag](./?path=/docs/styles-sd-flag--docs) can be used for similar purposes. Use them consistently throughout your product and, if both are needed, be sure to define which categories each should be used for (e.g. a chip on an article teaser informs about its subject, the flag about the type of article).

#### Chips and Tags

- Use only as a non-interactive element; for interactive elements (e.g., a dynamic filter), use [sd-tag](./?path=/docs/styles-sd-tag--docs) instead.

### Accessibility Information

- Since chips are non-interactive, ensure they are marked in a way that prevents them from receiving focus.
- If the chip text is already conveyed in the teaser body, consider hiding the chip from screen readers using aria-hidden="true" to prevent repeating the same information.
- If the chip adds unique context, it should be part of the teaser’s overall accessible description.
