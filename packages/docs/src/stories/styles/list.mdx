### Common Use Cases

- Arrange content into numbered or bulleted lists to improve readability and help users digest information quickly.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Content and Styling

- Incorporate content icons to visually differentiate list items, but use them sparingly to avoid cognitive load in lengthy lists with a different icons.
- Use numbered lists when there’s a particular order or hierarchy between its elements.
- Apply bold text to emphasize essential details or terminology and include hyperlinks where relevant to direct users to external pages or sections.

#### Nesting

- Keep nesting to a minimum—excessive levels can overwhelm users and complicate scanning.
- Break out sub-points into their own list when nesting levels exceed two or three.

#### Background

- Use light background options like white, neutral-100, primary-100, or use a primary background when inverted.

### Accessibility Information

- Limit nested levels to keep list structure clear and easily manageable for screen readers.
- Mark decorative icons as aria-hidden="true" if they provide no additional meaning, and ensure descriptive text is provided for icons that convey crucial information.
