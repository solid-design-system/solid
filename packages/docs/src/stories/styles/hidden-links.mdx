### Common Use Cases

- Provide skip-to-content links for screen readers or keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation and jump directly to the main content.
- Boost SEO by creating internal links that help search engines crawl and index content, even if the links aren’t visible to sighted users.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Implementation & Behavior

- Include at least one “Skip to Content” link, visible on first Tab press.
- Reveal up to three hidden links sequentially as the user tabs through.
- Use a hidden dropdown if more than three links are needed, auto-focusing the first menu item.

#### Focus & Navigation

- Ensure each hidden link is visible on focus and follows a logical tab order.
- Dismiss the hidden link or menu once a selection is made or the user tabs away.

#### Labels & Clarity

- Use concise, descriptive labels (e.g., “Skip to Footer”).
- Avoid creating duplicate or overlapping hidden links that offer the same navigation outcomes.

#### SEO Impact

- Link to relevant content so search engines can still crawl hidden links.
- Ensure hidden links provide genuine value; empty or misleading links can negatively affect both user experience and SEO.
