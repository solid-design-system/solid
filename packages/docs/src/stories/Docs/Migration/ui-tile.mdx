# Migration Guide: From `ui-tile` to `sd-teaser`

## [`ui-tile`] is deprecated

The `ui-tile` component will not be a part of the SDS Library. The `sd-teaser`, through the usage of slots can be customized to replicate the function of `ui-tile`. Refer to this [sample](https://solid-design-system.fe.union-investment.de/x.x.x/storybook/?path=/story/components-sd-teaser--samples-center-teaser-with-icon) for guidance.
