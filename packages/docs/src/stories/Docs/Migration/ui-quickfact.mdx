# Migration Guide: From `ui-quickfact` to `sd-quickfact`

The new `sd-quickfact` is designed to replace the `ui-quickfact`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-quickfact` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## 💾 Slots

### ✨ New Slots

#### [default]

The quickfacts main content.

#### [icon]

The quickfact's icon. Only content-icons should be used here.

#### [summary]

The quickfact's summary.

#### [expand-icon]

The icon that indicates the quickfact is closed.

#### [collapse-icon]

The icon that indicates the quickfact is open.
