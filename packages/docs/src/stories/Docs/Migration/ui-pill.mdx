# Migration Guide: From `ui-pill` to `sd-tag`

The new `sd-tag` is designed to replace the `ui-pill`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-tag` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## 💾 Slots

### ✨ New Slots

#### [default]

Contains the main content of the tag.

#### [removable-indicator]

Contains the removability indicator of the tag. By default this is a close icon.

## ⚙️ Attributes

### ✨ New Attributes

#### [download]

The `download` attribute may be used to tell the browser to download the linked file with the specified filename. If the `href` attribute is omitted, the `target` and `download` attribute are ignored.

**Hint:** When the `href` attribute is set i.e. the `sd-tag` is rendered as a link (`<a>`), the `disabled` attribute is ignored, as links may not be disabled. To disable the `sd-tag` the `href` attribute has to be removed as well.

#### [removable]

The new `removable` attribute controls whether or not the tag should display a close icon (`x`) next to the label of the tag to indicate that the filtered attribute may be removed.

#### [size]

The `sd-tag` component offers two different sizes:

- `lg` is the default size
- `sm` size is an alternative size for use in very tight spaces

### 🔀 Updated Attributes

#### [active]

The attribute `active` has been renamed to `selected`.
