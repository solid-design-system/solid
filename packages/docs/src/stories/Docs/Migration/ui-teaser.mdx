# Migration Guide: From `ui-teaser` to `sd-teaser`

The new `sd-teaser` is designed to replace the `ui-teaser`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-teaser` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## 💾 Slots

### ✨ New Slots

#### [default]

Contains the main content of the teaser.

#### [media]

A slot to provide media content for the teaser.

#### [meta]

A slot to provide metadata for the teaser.

#### [headline]

A slot to provide the headline for the teaser.

<hr />

## ⚙️ Attributes

### ✨ New Attributes

#### [breakpoint]

The `breakpoint` attribute is a new addition that determines when the teaser switches from `vertical` to `horizontal`. `0` is always `horizontal`, `9999` is always `vertical`. Default value is `448`.

#### [inset]

The `inset` attribute is used to set the inner padding of the teaser. This is always set in `white border-neutral-400` variant.

### 🔀 Updated Attributes

#### [variant]

The `variant` attribute has been updated to support the following values : `white` | `white border-neutral-400` | `neutral-100` | `primary` | `primary-100`.

### ❌ Removed Attributes

The following attributes have been removed from the new sd-teaser component:

1. [headline]
2. [text]
3. [image]
4. [imageAltText]
5. [imageMouseover]
6. [date]
7. [category]
8. [author]
9. [alignButton]
10. [mediaSelection]
11. [videoSrc]
12. [videoLoopSetting]
13. [replace]
14. [sizes]
15. [links]
16. [utilityLinks]
17. [isTextFloating]

If these properties are required, you should implement them using slots in the new `sd-teaser` component.

<hr />

## ✍️ CSS Variables

### ✨ New CSS Variables

#### [--distribution-media]

The distribution ratio of the media.

#### [--distribution-content]

The distribution ratio of the content.
This can only be used when the orientation is horizontal. In case there's a requirement to have a fixed value for the media or content, you can override the sd-teaser::part(media) or sd-teaser::part(content) selector by applying a flex-shrink of 0.

```css
sd-teaser::part(media) {
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
```
