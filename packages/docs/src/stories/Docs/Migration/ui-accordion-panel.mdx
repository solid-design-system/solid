# Migration Guide: From `ui-accordion-panel` to `sd-accordion`

The new `sd-accordion` is designed to replace the `ui-accordion-panel`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-accordion` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## üíæ Slots

### ‚ú® New Slots

#### [default]

- Contains the main content of the accordion.

#### [summary]

- Provides the summary for the accordion header.
- This can be an alternative to using the `summary` attribute directly inside the `sd-accordion` component (similar to `ui-accordion-panel`.

#### [expand-icon]

- an (optional) expand icon to use in the place of the default. Works best with `sd-icon`.

#### [collapse-icon]

- an (optional) collapse icon to use in the place of the default. Works best with `sd-icon`.
