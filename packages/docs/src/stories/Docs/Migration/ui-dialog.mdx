# Migration Guide: From `ui-dialog` to `sd-dialog`

The new `sd-dialog` is designed to replace the `ui-dialog`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-dialog` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## 💾 Slots

### ✨ New Slots

#### [headline]

The dialog's headline that can be used for complex content.

#### [footer]

A footer section to add additional elements, such as buttons.

<hr />

## ⚙️ Attributes

### ✨ New Attributes

#### [open]

Indicates whether or not the dialog is open.

#### [headline]

Can be used to set the dialog's headline as displayed in the header. If you need to display HTML, use the `headline` slot instead.

#### [noCloseButton]

This will remove the default close button. Please ensure you provide an easy, accessible way for users to dismiss the dialog.

### ❌ Removed Attributes

The following attributes have been removed from the new sd-dialog component:

1. [blurBackground]
2. [restrictClose]
3. [openByDefault]

<hr />

## ✍️ CSS Variables

### ✨ New CSS Variables

#### [--width]

Sets the preferred width of the dialog. Note that the dialog will shrink to accommodate smaller screens.

<hr />

## 🥳 Events

### ✨ New Events

#### [sd-after-show]

Emitted after the dialog opens and all animations are complete.

#### [sd-after-hide]

Emitted after the dialog closes and all animations are complete.

#### [sd-initial-focus]

Emitted when the dialog opens and is ready to receive focus. Calling `event.preventDefault()` will prevent focusing and allow you to set it on a different element, such as an input.

#### [sd-request-close]

Emitted when the user attempts to close the dialog by clicking the close button, clicking the overlay, or pressing escape. Calling `event.preventDefault()` will keep the dialog open. Avoid using this unless closing the dialog will result in destructive behavior such as data loss.

### 🔄 Updated Events

#### [sd-show]

Renamed from `uiDialogShow`

#### [sd-hide]

Renamed from `uiDialogClose`

<hr />

## 🧪 Methods

### 🔄 Updated Methods

#### [hide]
