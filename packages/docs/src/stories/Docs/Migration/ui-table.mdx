# Migration Guide: From `ui-table` to `sd-table` and `sd-table-cell`

The new `sd-table` and `sd-table-cell` are designed to replace the `ui-table`. Rather than offering a complex component structure, they primarily focus on providing CSS styles for `<table>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements.

As a result, tables no longer require the `ui-table` wrapper and instead can directly utilize the provided CSS classes.

## 🎨 CSS Classes

### ✨ New CSS Classes

#### [sd-table]

The `sd-table` class is intended for use with the `<table>` element and effectively resets the table styles like padding and border.

#### [sd-table-cell]

The `sd-table-cell` class should be applied to both `<th>` and `<td>` elements. It introduces top and bottom borders to the cell and defines font size, text alignment and padding.

#### [sd-table-cell--divider]

This class adds a divider to the right side of the table cell.

#### [sd-table-cell--bg-transparent]

This class adds a transparent background color to the table cell.

#### [sd-table-cell--bg-white]

This class adds a white background color to the table cell.

#### [sd-table-cell--bg-primary-100]

This class adds a background color of primary-100 to the table cell.

#### [sd-table-cell--bg-neutral-100]

This class adds a background color of neutral-100 to the table cell.
