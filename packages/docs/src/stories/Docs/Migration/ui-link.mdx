# Migration Guide: From `ui-link` to `sd-link`

The new `sd-link` is designed to replace the `ui-link`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-link` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Attributes

### ‚ú® New Attributes

#### [standalone]

The `ui-link` posed two problems:

- The component automatically wraps to a new line, forcing subsequent content to a new line. This breaks away from the default `<a>` behavior, causing problems particularly in CMS Rich Text Editors where true inline behavior isn't possible.
- Icons within the component are always displayed inline, even if the text wraps across multiple lines. This often leads to misuse of the component and unexpected behavior.

`sd-link` resolves these issues with the `standalone` attribute that controls the layout of the icon and text within the component:

- `false` (Default): Icons are displayed inline with the text, mimicking the default `<a>` element behavior. Icons adjust their spacing according to the current font size.
- `true`: The link moves to a new line, with the icon and text displayed side-by-side, each in its own column.

#### [size]

The `sd-link` component offers three different sizes:

- The default size, `inherit`, adapts the font size from the parent element, especially useful for non-`standalone` links.
- The `lg` and `sm` sizes set predefined font sizes, beneficial for `standalone` links.

### ‚ùå Removed Attributes

The following attributes have been removed from the new sd-link component:

1. [button]
2. [icon]
   The `sd-button` and `sd-link` no longer contain an `icon` attribute. They instead offer new `icon-left` and `icon-right` slots.
3. [icon-option]
   The `sd-button` and `sd-link` no longer offer an `icon-option` attribute. You can place icons in the main slot, which automatically adjusts the padding.
4. [delay]
5. [conversion]

## üí™ Additional Changes

### Links that look like _buttons_

If you have links that should resemble buttons, use the new `sd-button`. By setting a `href` attribute, you can leverage all attributes of an original HTML anchor, thereby providing more options than before. Refer to the `sd-button` documentation for further details.

### Links that look like _links_

The new `sd-link` offers styles for links that may span more than one line and always display an underline.
