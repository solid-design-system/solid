# Migration Guide: From `ui-button` to `sd-button`

The new `sd-button` is designed to replace the `ui-button`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-button` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## ⚙️ Attributes

### ✨ New Attributes

#### [load]

The `load` attribute improves handling of buttons that display a loading state. In the past, manual intervention was necessary to control this state. Now, simply set the `load` attribute. It activates an `sd-spinner`, maintains the current content (and consequently, the width), and manages all essential HTML and A11y features.

### 🔀 Updated Attributes

#### [variant/transparent]

The attribute argument `variant/transparent` has been renamed to `variant/tertiary` to accurately represent the button hierarchy. To enhance user experience, its behavior on hover has been updated; it now changes background instead of applying an underline.

### ❌ Removed Attributes

The following attributes have been removed from the new sd-button component:

1. [variant/plain]
   If you require a more minimal link component, please utilize the `sd-link` component.
2. [icon]
   The `sd-button` no longer includes an `icon` attribute. Instead, it provides a slot for the same purpose.

```html
<sd-button
  <ui-icon slot="icon-left" ...></ui-icon>
</sd-button>
```

## ✍️ CSS variables

### ❌ Removed CSS variables

The following CSS variables have been removed from the new sd-button component:

1. [--component-button-...]

<hr />

## 💪 Additional Changes

## ✨ New `icon-only` state

The `icon-only` state activates when an `sd-icon` is placed inside the main slot of an `sd-button`. In this state, the button automatically becomes square, embodying an `icon-only` button.

## ❌ Automatic Color Inversion

In our pursuit of creating standalone, robust components, the `sd-button` does not automatically invert its colors based on CSS variables from higher elements in the DOM. Instead, to invert colors, you simply need to add the `inverted` attribute.
