# Introduction for Migration

This is the migration guide for the Solid Design System from "Component Library" (built with Stencil) to "Solid Components" (built with LitElement).

## Global Changes

### CSS Variables

We have discontinued component-specific CSS variables. You can now alter colors and padding using the part selector. Alternatively, override CSS variables used within the element as needed.

```css
sd-button::part(base) {
  background: pink;
  color: black;
}
```

As an alternative you can override CSS variables used in the element:

```css
sd-button {
  --sd-spacing-4: 15px; /* overrides default 16px */
}
```

### ðŸš« Discontinued ui-components from [Component Library](https://component-library.fe.union-investment.de/latest/storybook/index.html)

Teams that have been using the following components should be aware that they will **not** be supported in the **Solid Design System (SDS) library**. If you have been relying on these components, itâ€™s essential to implement their functionality in your own custom library.

> Note: Our practice involves detailed discussions about each UI component before migrating it into the SDS. As a result, this list will be regularly updated and adjusted.

- `ui-contact`: The functionality of this component is too specific to be included in the SDS.
- `ui-link-list`: Simimar to `ui-contact`, the functionality of this component is too specific.
- `ui-iframe`: This component is removed as unlike, `ui-video`, `sd-video` does not depend on it.
- `ui-portal`: The component adds unnecessary complexity to the library.
- `ui-superteaser`: The functionality of this component is too specific to be included in the SDS.
- `ui-text-image`: The component addresses a very specific or rare use case that doesn't justify its continued inclusion in the library.
- `ui-tag-group`: This component is easily replicable using the sd-tag component with custom CSS styles (e.g., flexbox).
- `ui-qr-code`: The component is not widely used across projects or by the target audience, making it unnecessary to maintain within the SDS.
- `ui-social-follow-links`: The component adds unnecessary complexity to the library, both in terms of usage and maintenance.
- `ui-social-share-buttons`: Similar to `ui-social-follow-links`, this component adds unnecessary complexity to the library.
- `ui-teaser-article`: The functionality provided by the component is already covered by `sd-teaser` and `sd-media-teaser`.
- `ui-surrounding-map`: This component was heavily dependent on the Google Maps API and had often changing requirements. The SDS provides the `sd-map-marker` to be used inside a Google Maps map and in addition to this a guide on how to customize a Google Maps implementation by using the [Google Maps Style Wizard](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/).
