# Migration from v1

## Opt-in for "Valid Styles"

Before this change `sd-input`, `sd-select` and
`sd-textarea` immediately showed "valid styles" (success color +
checkmark) immediately when an form field was valid. In most cases this
isn't relevant, e. g. in search fields, app interfaces etc.
With this change you now have to explicitly set the attribute
`style-on-valid` on the mentioned components to show "valid styles", as
soon as the component is valid.

**Before**:

```html
<sd-input></sd-input>
<!-- Shows valid styles when valid -->
```

**After**:

```html
<sd-input></sd-input>
<!-- Does not show valid styles when valid -->

<sd-input style-on-valid></sd-input>
<!-- Shows valid styles when valid -->
```
