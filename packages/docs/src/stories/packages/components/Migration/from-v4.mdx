# Migration from v4

## Component updates

### `<sd-icon>`

Internal icons library have been renamed from `system` to `_internal`.

**Before:**

```html
<sd-icon library="system" name="chevron-down"></sd-icon>
```

**After:**

```html
<sd-icon library="_internal" name="chevron-down"></sd-icon>
```

### `<sd-scrollable>`

The `start` and `end` events were being emitted incorrectly.

**Before:**

- `start` event was emitted when there was available scrolling space in the `start` direction
- `end` event was emitted when there was available scrolling space in the `end` direction

**After:**

- `start` event is emitted when the `start` is reached.
- `end` event is emitted when the `end` is reached.

### `<sd-header>`

The `sd-header` component now automatically creates a space below itself when the fixed attribute is present. This prevents content from being overlapped without requiring manual margin or padding.

**Before:**

An offset had to be implemented manually using the `--sd-header-calculated-height` variable.

```html
<sd-header fixed>
  <!-- Your content -->
</sd-header>
<main style="margin-top: var(--sd-header-calculated-height);">
  <!-- Your content -->
</main>
```

**After:**

Offset can be removed, as the header creates the space automatically.

```html
<sd-header fixed>
  <!-- Your content -->
</sd-header>
<main>
  <!-- Your content -->
</main>
```

### `<sd-badge>`

The `role="status"` internal attribute has been removed to give developers more control over accessibility semantics.
This change ensures that badges are no longer automatically treated as live regions, which may not always be the intended behaviour.

**Before:**

Badge updates were always announced:

```html
<sd-badge variant="green" size="md">
  <span>5</span>
  <span class="sr-only">Notifications</span>
</sd-badge>
```

**After**

Now, if you want the badge to be announced, add `role="status"` manually:

```html
<sd-badge variant="green" size="md" role="status">
  <span>5</span>
  <span class="sr-only">Notifications</span>
</sd-badge>
```
