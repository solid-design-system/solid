# Usage

We provide a set of CSS classes that can be used to style your application. They follow the [BEM](http://getbem.com/) methodology and are mainly used when building a full-fledged component would be way too much or could harm a11y.

You can use them as any other CSS class:

```html
<span class="sd-meta sd-meta--pipe sd-meta--size-sm">Lorem Ipsum</span>
```

Have in mind that we're using BEM methodology â€“ therefore modifiers (like `sd-meta--pipe` and `sd-meta--size-sm`) always need the base class (like `sd-meta`).
