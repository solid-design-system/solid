# Accessibility Tests

Accessibility (a11y) is an integral part of modern web development,
ensuring that applications are inclusive and usable by all individuals.

## Executing tests

To execute the accessibility tests, the command `pnpm test` must be run.
In case it is being run without any preview running, the command will `build, preview and run the tests`.
In case a preview is already running on a separate terminal, the command will just `run the tests`.

`pnpm test.watch` can also be executed, to run the tests in watch mode.
To do so, storybook has to be running on a separate terminal in dev mode, `pnpm dev`.

## Using custom tags for accessibility tests

Custom tags can be used in Storybook stories for better control and customization of
accessibility testing. These tags can help you skip tests globally or
target specific rules for exceptions. Here's how to use them:

### `skip-a11y`

The `skip-a11y` tag can be added to a story to completely skip all accessibility checks
for that particular story. This can be useful for drafts or components under development
that are not yet ready for a11y testing.

**Example:**

```js
export default {
  title: 'Components/sd-component',
  component: 'sd-component',
  tags: ['skip-a11y']
};
```

### skip-a11y-[specific rules]

To skip specific accessibility rules for a story, use the skip-a11y-[rule names] format.
This can be helpful when certain rules are irrelevant or when addressing an issue is planned for later.
Rules are set between square brackets and separated by commas.

**Example:**

```js
export default {
  title: 'Components/sd-component',
  component: 'sd-component',
  tags: ['skip-a11y-[color-contrast, label]']
};
```

In this example, only the color-contrast and label rules are skipped during testing.

## Debugging failing accessibility tests

When a test fails, two direct URLs are printed into the console, `story` and `browser`.

- The story url links to the story file which the test is failling.
- The browser url links to the storybook story on the browser which is failling.

## Open the failing test in the browser

1. **Find the `browser` URL:** When an a11y test fails, it outputs a URL pointing to the rendered story.
2. **Copy the `browser` URL:** Copy the URL from the output.
3. **Open the URL in the browser:** Paste the `browser` URL into your browser to open the story in isolation.

## Resolve issues

Once the story is loaded:

- Accessibility violations can be found under the **Accessibility** tab.
- Review the flagged accessibility violations.
- Make the necessary adjustments to the component or story.
- Rerun the tests or refresh the browser to confirm the fixes.
