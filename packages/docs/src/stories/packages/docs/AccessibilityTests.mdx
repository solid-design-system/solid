# Accessibility Tests

Accessibility (a11y) is an integral part of modern web development,
ensuring that applications are inclusive and usable by all individuals.

## Executing tests

To execute the accessibility tests, the command `pnpm test` must be run.
In case it is being run without any preview running, the command will `build, preview and run the tests`.
In case a preview is already running on a separate terminal, the command will just `run the tests`.

## Using a11y configuration to skip rules

In Storybook stories, it's possible to configure accessibility settings to skip specific rules. This can be helpful when certain rules are irrelevant or when addressing an issue is planned for later. Here's how to use them:

Inside the `parameters` object of a story, you can add an `a11y` property with a `config` object. Within this config, you can specify the `rules` array, where each rule can be enabled or disabled using its `id`.

**Example:**

```js
export default {
  title: 'Components/sd-component',
  component: 'sd-component',
  parameters: {
    ...parameters,
    a11y: {
      config: {
        rules: [
          {
            id: 'aria-required-parent',
            enabled: false
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
};
```

## Debugging failing accessibility tests

When debugging accessibility tests, to achieve a better developer experience,
it is recommended to check the violations and passes on the `Accessibility tab`.
To check this tab, open the docs in development mode (`pnpm dev`),
select a specific story and click on the story "Accessibility" tab.

### Running `pnpm test`

When a test fails, two direct URLs are printed into the console, `story` and `browser`.

- The story url links to the story file which the test is failling.
- The browser url links to the storybook story on the browser which is failling.

## Open the failing test in the browser

1. Make sure the local development server is running (`pnpm dev`)
2. **Find the `browser` URL:** When an a11y test fails, it outputs a URL pointing to the rendered story.
3. **Copy the `browser` URL:** Copy the URL from the output.
4. **Open the URL in the browser:** Paste the `browser` URL into your browser to open the story in isolation.

## Resolve issues

Once the story is loaded:

- Accessibility violations can be found under the **Accessibility** tab.
- Review the flagged accessibility violations.
- Make the necessary adjustments to the component or story.
- Rerun the tests or refresh the browser to confirm the fixes.
