## Usage

```bash
npm i @solid-design-system/placeholders
```

## Storybook integration

To integrate this package into your Storybook you need to add the following lines of code to the Storybook `main.js` file:

```js
  staticDirs: [
    {
      from: '../node_modules/@solid-design-system/placeholders/src/images',
      to: '/placeholders',
    },
  ],
```

After adding this package to the `staticDirs` of your Storybook the `src/images` folder will be included in your `storybook` build folder under the subfolder `storybook/placeholders`.
To reference a image in your story you can follow this example:

```js
'./placeholders/collaboration.jpg';
```
