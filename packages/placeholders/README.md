# Solid Placeholders

This package provides placeholder texts and images.

## Texts

The file `solid-faker` provides a class with several utility functions for generating random / pseudo-random Lorem Ipsum style texts.

```
// Import the SolidFaker class
import SolidFaker from '@solid-design-system/placeholders';

// Create an instance with an optional seed value as the only argument
const faker = new SolidFaker(123);

// Set the seed to any other number to provide a different set of consistent results
faker.seed(321);

// Set the seed to undefined for random results on each invocation
faker.seed();

// Generate 5 random words (all lowercase)
console.log(faker.words(5));

// Generate 5 random words with first word capitalized
console.log(faker.words(5, 1));

// Generate 5 random words with all words capitalized
console.log(faker.words(5, 2));

// Generate 3 random sentences
console.log(faker.sentences(3));

// Generate 2 random paragraphs
console.log(faker.paragraphs(2));
```

## Usage

```bash
npm i @solid-design-system/placeholders
```

## Storybook integration

To integrate the images in this package into your Storybook you need to add the following lines of code to the Storybook `main.js` file:

```js
  staticDirs: [
    {
      from: '../node_modules/@solid-design-system/placeholders/src/images',
      to: '/placeholders',
    },
  ],
```

After adding this package to the `staticDirs` of your Storybook the `src/images` folder will be included in your `storybook` build folder under the subfolder `storybook/placeholders`.
To reference a image in your story you can follow this example:

```js
'./placeholders/collaboration.jpg';
```
