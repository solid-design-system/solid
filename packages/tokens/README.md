The Solid Design System Tokens package provides a collection of themes, design tokens for colors, typography and spacing. It ensures design consistency and collaboration between our designers and developers when building components for the Solid Design System.

Themes can be used for different purposes such as dark and light mode or to align with a specific brand. For further information on how to work with themes go to [Multi theming documentation](./?path=/docs/packages-tokens-installation--docs).

Check out the [full documentation](https://solid-design-system.fe.union-investment.de/docs/) for detailed information.
