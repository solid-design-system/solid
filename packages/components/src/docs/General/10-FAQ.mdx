  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">What is the Solid Design System?</h3>

The Solid Design System by Union Investment establishes a robust framework for their digital presence, offering a
comprehensive array of design elements and guidelines. Including navigation items, buttons, and more, it serves as
an invaluable tool for designers and developers working on Union Investment’s digital offerings. Providing
atomic-level components, it forms the foundational elements for ensuring uniform and seamless user interfaces across
their digital products. Unlike full designs, these components enable the creation of customized interfaces while
upholding visual consistency and usability standards.

  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">What do I get from the Solid Design System</h3>

In accordance with the principles of the Atomic Design Methodology, we furnish atoms and molecules for constructing organisms, templates, and ultimately, pages. Each element in our Solid Design System adheres to WCAG 2.2 criteria, prioritizing accessibility, and we strive to maintain their lightweight nature. By providing all components with a corporate design check and motion principles, we strengthen the brand and create a recognizable and consistent look and feel.
Providing HTML-based components promotes sustainability by reducing resource consumption, improving performance, and ensuring compatibility and accessibility. By simplifying development and maintenance processes, we minimize environmental impact while maximizing efficiency in the software lifecycle.

  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">How should I be using the Solid Design System and why?</h3>

Considering the query above, our Solid Design System, integrated seamlessly with Figma for prototyping and design, guarantees that all components, styles, samples, and patterns maintain brand conformity across diverse web contexts, while also ensuring full accessibility, compliance with design standards, and lightweight performance for websites or applications. This unified approach enables early testing of design concepts in Figma, allowing for efficient iteration and user feedback incorporation, ultimately delivering a cohesive and on-brand user experience

<sd-accordion>
  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">What are the 3 core principles of the Solid Design System?</h3>

Solid Components, as part of the Solid Design System, serving as a robust foundation for a digital presence, built upon three core principles:

1. 🌟 Usable & consistent
2. 🧩 Reusable & flexible
3. 🛠️ Maintainable & reliable

Visit our [introduction page](https://solid-design-system.fe.union-investment.de/x.x.x/storybook/index.html?path=/docs/docs-general-introduction--docs#principles) for more details.

<sd-accordion>
  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">How do components, styles, samples, and patterns differ in our library?</h3>

In our library, we offer four distinct types of elements:

1. Components: These are lightweight [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components) constructed with [lit](https://lit.dev/).
2. Styles: These are even lighter CSS classes that can be applied to any HTML element.
3. Samples: These are practical demonstrations showcasing the usage of our components and styles within specific contexts.
4. Patterns: These are predefined use-cases designed to address specific design requirements without the need for a dedicated component.

Visit our [introduction page](https://solid-design-system.fe.union-investment.de/x.x.x/storybook/index.html?path=/docs/docs-general-introduction--docs#structure) for more details.

<sd-accordion>
  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">How can I submit a feature request or report a bug?</h3>

To do so, navigate to the issue section on GitHub and utilize our provided issue templates. Whether you're suggesting a new feature or reporting a bug, these templates offer placeholders and designated content sections where you can input the necessary information. Please ensure to include as many detailed specifics as possible when submitting your request or bug report.

<sd-accordion>
  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">Will the development of the Solid Design System be finished at some point?</h3>

No, the Solid Design System is an ongoing endeavor, much like the ever-evolving nature of the web itself. We are committed to continually refining and expanding its features, ensuring it remains aligned with the latest standards and technologies.

<sd-accordion>
  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary"> Does the use of the Solid Design System guarantee my website's accessibility?</h3>

No, although our components, styles, samples, and patterns are meticulously crafted to meet WCAG 2.2 specifications individually, they alone do not ensure comprehensive web accessibility. They constitute only a part of your website or application, and achieving full accessibility requires attention to your usage, content, and overall structure. While implementing Solid Components into your product is a crucial initial step toward accessibility, it doesn't guarantee compliance. Each use of a component on a page necessitates consideration of context and content order, ensuring correct and meaningful semantics. Product teams must assume responsibility for maintaining compliance with these standards in their digital products based on Solid DS.

<h1 className="sd-headline sd-headline--size-3xl">Technical Questions</h1>
<sd-accordion-group>
<sd-accordion>
  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary"> Why do we rely on basic HTML standards?</h3>

We rely on basic HTML standards because they provide a solid foundation for web development, ensuring compatibility across different browsers and devices. HTML standards define the structure and semantics of web content, which is crucial for accessibility and search engine optimization. By adhering to these standards, we promote consistency, reliability, and interoperability in web development, ultimately enhancing user experience and facilitating collaboration within the web community.

  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">What is the story behind the "Design Tokens"?</h3>

Design tokens were first introduced by Salesforce in 2014. They have been used in design and development practices ever since.
Design tokens are labels or names given to different design elements, such as colors, sizes, or fonts from design choices & decisions. They help separate specific values from the elements they represent. For example #181818 can be registered as “black" and #00358E as “blue.default". “black" and “blue.default" then can be used as text color options as “text.black" & “text.primary".
By using design tokens, designers can easily update or change values without having to make adjustments everywhere. Tokens act as a central place to manage design values, making it easier to maintain a consistent design. For example another value can replace #181818 as an alias to the color token “black".
