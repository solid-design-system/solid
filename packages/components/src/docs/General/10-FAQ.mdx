  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">What is the Solid Design System?</h3>
  <span className="sb-unstyled">
    The Solid Design System by Union Investment establishes a robust framework for their digital presence, offering a
    comprehensive array of design elements and guidelines. Including navigation items, buttons, and more, it serves as
    an invaluable tool for designers and developers working on Union Investment’s digital offerings. Providing
    atomic-level components, it forms the foundational elements for ensuring uniform and seamless user interfaces across
    their digital products. Unlike full designs, these components enable the creation of customized interfaces while
    upholding visual consistency and usability standards.

  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">
    What do I get from the Solid Design System
  </h3>
  <span className="sb-unstyled">
    In accordance with the principles of the Atomic Design Methodology, we furnish atoms and molecules for constructing
    organisms, templates, and ultimately, pages. Each element in our Solid Design System adheres to WCAG 2.2 criteria,
    prioritizing accessibility, and we strive to maintain their lightweight nature. By providing all components with a
    corporate design check and motion principles, we strengthen the brand and create a recognizable and consistent look
    and feel. Providing HTML-based components promotes sustainability by reducing resource consumption, improving
    performance, and ensuring compatibility and accessibility. By simplifying development and maintenance processes, we
    minimize environmental impact while maximizing efficiency in the software lifecycle.

<sd-accordion>
  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">
    How should I be using the Solid Design System and why?
  </h3>
  <span className="sb-unstyled">
    Considering the query above, our Solid Design System, integrated seamlessly with Figma for prototyping and design,
    guarantees that all components, styles, samples, and patterns maintain brand conformity across diverse web contexts,
    while also ensuring full accessibility, compliance with design standards, and lightweight performance for websites
    or applications. This unified approach enables early testing of design concepts in Figma, allowing for efficient
    iteration and user feedback incorporation, ultimately delivering a cohesive and on-brand user experience

<sd-accordion>
  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">What are the 3 core principles of the Solid Design System?</h3>
  <span className="sb-unstyled">
    Solid Components, as part of the Solid Design System, serving as a robust foundation for a digital presence, built upon three core principles:

    1. 🌟 Usable & consistent
    2. 🧩 Reusable & flexible
    3. 🛠️ Maintainable & reliable

<sd-accordion>
  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">How do components, styles, samples, and patterns differ in our library?</h3>
  <span className="sb-unstyled">
    In our library, we offer four distinct types of elements:

    1. Components: These are lightweight [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components) constructed with [lit](https://lit.dev/).
    2. Styles: These are even lighter CSS classes that can be applied to any HTML element.
    3. Samples: These are practical demonstrations showcasing the usage of our components and styles within specific contexts.
    4. Patterns: These are predefined use-cases designed to address specific design requirements without the need for a dedicated component.

    Visit our [introduction page](https://solid-design-system.fe.union-investment.de/x.x.x/storybook/index.html?path=/docs/docs-general-introduction--docs#structure) for more details.

  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">
    What is the suggested workflow between Design and DEV in the project-specific teams? 
  </h3>
  <span className="sb-unstyled">
    A collaborative workflow between design and development teams is crucial for the success of any project. We recommend the following steps:

    1. Initial Alignment: Begin with a kick-off meeting to ensure both designers and developers understand Solid DS and its capabilities.
    2. Design Phase: Designers build prototypes based on Solid DS components, customising them whenever necessary while collaborating with developers to ensure feasibility. They also make all the relevant accessibility comments for later hand-off.
    3. Hand-off Process: Designers provide detailed documentation and conduct design review sessions to ensure developers understand the specifications and rationale.
    4. Development Phase: Maintain close communication, with regular check-ins and iterative testing to ensure designs are implemented accurately.
    5. Final Review: Conduct a joint review to verify that the project meets design specifications and functions as intended.
    6. Post-Launch: Keep a feedback loop for continuous improvement in future features and projects.

  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">
    Do I need to create a project-specific component library?
  </h3>
  <span className="sb-unstyled">
    Your project structure should leverage the Solid Design System’s components, styles, samples, and patterns as
    foundational elements. While it’s not mandatory to create a project-specific component library, doing so can help
    manage customizations and extensions specific to your project. This approach ensures that your project remains
    aligned with the Solid Design System while accommodating unique requirements.

    Does the use of the Solid Design System guarantee my website's accessibility?
  </h3>
  <span className="sb-unstyled">
    No. Although our components, styles, samples, and patterns are meticulously crafted to meet WCAG 2.2 specifications
    individually, they alone do not ensure comprehensive web accessibility. They constitute only a part of your website
    or application, and achieving full accessibility requires attention to your usage, content, and overall structure.
    While implementing Solid Components into your product is a crucial initial step toward accessibility, it doesn't
    guarantee compliance. Each use of a component on a page necessitates consideration of context and content order,
    ensuring correct and meaningful semantics. Product teams must assume responsibility for maintaining compliance with
    these standards in their digital products based on Solid DS.

<sd-accordion>
  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">Can I use the Solid Design System for my private projects?</h3>
  <span className="sb-unstyled">
    The Solid Design System is intended for use within the Union Investment universe. While it is an open-source project, its commercial use is restricted to Union Investment and its associated projects. However, it can be used if the components' form and color are altered to avoid resemblance to the original corporate design. This "whitelabeling" process ensures the system is adapted to fit your project's unique style.

<sd-accordion>
  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">Why do we rely on basic HTML standards?</h3>
  <span className="sb-unstyled">
    We rely on basic HTML standards because they provide a solid foundation for web development, ensuring compatibility across different browsers and devices. HTML standards define the structure and semantics of web content, which is crucial for accessibility and search engine optimization. By adhering to these standards, we promote consistency, reliability, and interoperability in web development, ultimately enhancing user experience and facilitating collaboration within the web community.

  <h3 className="text-base sb-unstyled" slot="summary">What is the story behind the "Design Tokens"?</h3>
  <span className="sb-unstyled">
    Design tokens were first introduced by Salesforce in 2014. They have been used in design and development practices ever since.
    Design tokens are labels or names given to different design elements, such as colors, sizes, or fonts from design choices & decisions. They help separate specific values from the elements they represent. For example #181818 can be registered as “black" and #00358E as “blue.default". “black" and “blue.default" then can be used as text color options as “text.black" & “text.primary".
    By using design tokens, designers can easily update or change values without having to make adjustments everywhere. Tokens act as a central place to manage design values, making it easier to maintain a consistent design. For example another value can replace #181818 as an alias to the color token “black".
