# Introduction

Solid Components are part of the Solid Design System, serving as a robust foundation for Union Investment's digital presence, built upon three core principles:

1. 🌟 **Usable & consistent**
2. 🧩 **Reusable & flexible**
3. 🛠️ **Maintainable & reliable**

## 🌟 Usable & consistent

Our mission is to reflect the Union Investment brand in a consistent and accessible manner. Our strategies include:

- **Design System**: As part of the Solid Design System, Solid Components align with our brand guidelines.
- **Synced Design Tokens**: Ensuring uniform style and layout across components and fostering a common language between development and design.
- **Accessibility Standards**: Commitment to accessibility standards for all users.
- **Clear Guidelines**: Offering instructions for appropriate usage and arrangement of components.

Recognizing that not all scenarios can be pre-designed, we focus on building a core of consistent and adaptable components.

## 🧩 Reusable & flexible

Solid Components are designed to be adaptable and reusable across different projects:

- **Generalizability in view**: Components are crafted framework-agnostic with maximum generalizability and minimum required properties, enabling their usage across varied contexts.
- **Equivalent cooperation**: Components are designed for easy integration into different projects, seamlessly functioning with other systems.

Rather than catering to specific project needs, we aim to create versatile components applicable to a broad range of situations, enhancing their long-term value.

## 🛠️ Maintainable & reliable

Solid Components are designed to offer high reliability and easy maintainability:

- **"Dumber", declarative components**: Components free of business logic for easier updates.
- **Cautious feature implementation**: New features are carefully evaluated for their impact on reliability and maintainability.
- **Responsibility delegation to the application**: Lightweight components allowing for customization and greater flexibility.
- **Thorough testing**: High test coverage with E2E-Tests via Playwright (<a href={`https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v${playwrightVersion}`} target="\_blank">tested Browser versions</a>) and Visual Regression Tests via Chromatic ([current Browser versions](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/infrastructure-release-notes)).

Our emphasis is on creating a solid foundation of reliable, maintainable components that balance necessary features with ease of upkeep.
