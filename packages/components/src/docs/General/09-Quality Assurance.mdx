## VRT / QA Workflow

In order to ensure a certain level of quality and reliability, we use a combination of visual regression testing and manual QA.

### Development

#### Visual Regression Testing

We use Chromatic screenshot testing to ensure that our components are visually correct. This automatically runs on every PR and will show any visual changes that have been made. Changes can be approved or rejected and will be shown in the PR.

#### Code Analyzer

We use several automations to ensure that our code is consistent and correct. This includes:

- Quality Gate - this action builds the whole project, verifies linting, formatting and runs all tests
- File Size Check - this action communicates and compares the bundle size to monitor performance
- Validate PR Title - this action checks the PR title to ensure that it follows our naming conventions matching with sematic versioning
- CodeQL Scan - this action checks the code for any security vulnerabilities

The above actions are automatically run on every PR and are required to pass before the PR can be merged.

#### Manual QA

Besides the automatic checks, we also do manual QA on every PR. This includes:

- code review with a minimum of one reviewer
- testing the changes in a published feature environment

#### Details

A detailed description of the QA process can be found in the [VRT / QA Workflow File for Development](https://www.figma.com/file/yg2PKZ0ghndLBAPYm7kbaN/VRT-%2F-QA-Workflow?type=whiteboard&node-id=427-582&t=aJsKurM4wVpfftjE-4) in Figma.

### Design

#### Visual Regression Testing

VRT using dedicated Figma plugins is currently in evaluation for the design team.

#### UI Review

New/changed code components are reviewed by the design team using the Chromatic feature enviroment, Chromatic screenshot testing mentioned above and Storybook code inspection. This allows the design team to review the changes in the actual UI and not just in a design tool. The reviewer can either accept or reject the changes and leave comments. After all comments have been fixed, design reviews again and approves the PR on Chromatic if all design checks have been passed.

#### Figma Design Lint

We use the [Figma Design Lint Plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/735098356222747486/Figma-Design-Lint) to ensure that our designs are consistent and correct. This plugin checks the design for any inconsistencies and errors and will show them in the design file. The plugin is automatically run on every PR and is required to pass before the PR can be merged.
