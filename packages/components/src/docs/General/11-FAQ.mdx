        <span class="sd-prose">
          The Solid Design System by Union Investment establishes a robust framework for their digital presence, offering a
          comprehensive array of design elements and guidelines. Including navigation items, buttons, and more, it serves as
          an invaluable tool for designers and developers working on Union Investment's digital offerings. Providing
          atomic-level components, it forms the foundational elements for ensuring uniform and seamless user interfaces across
          their digital products. Unlike full designs, these components enable the creation of customized interfaces while
          upholding visual consistency and usability standards.

          What benefits does the Solid Design System provide?
        </h4>
        <span class="sd-prose">
          In accordance with the principles of the Atomic Design Methodology, we furnish atoms and molecules for constructing
          organisms, templates, and ultimately, pages. Each element in our Solid Design System adheres to WCAG 2.2 criteria,
          prioritizing accessibility, and we strive to maintain their lightweight nature. By providing all components with a
          corporate design check and motion principles, we strengthen the brand and create a recognizable and consistent look
          and feel. Providing HTML-based components promotes sustainability by reducing resource consumption, improving
          performance, and ensuring compatibility and accessibility. By simplifying development and maintenance processes, we
          minimize environmental impact while maximizing efficiency in the software lifecycle.

        <h4 class="text-base" slot="summary">What are the differences between components, styles and templates in our library?</h4>
        <span class="sd-prose">
          In our library, we offer four distinct types of elements:
          <ol class="sd-list">
            <li>Components: These are lightweight <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components">web components</a> constructed with [lit](https://lit.dev/). They are often more complex than Styles, and could feature reactivity, state, multiple slots, properties, and more.</li>
            <li>Styles: These are standalone CSS files. They don't provide any logic, are often non-interactive and can be applied to any HTML element.</li>
            <li>These are complete examples of how to use Styles and Components together. They are often more complex than Components and could feature multiple Components and Styles. They are meant to be copy-pasted and individualized for your project.</li>

          Does the use of the Solid Design System guarantee my website's accessibility?
        </h4>
        <span class="sd-prose">
          No. Although our components, styles and templates are meticulously crafted to meet WCAG 2.2 specifications
          individually, they alone do not ensure comprehensive web accessibility. They constitute only a part of your website
          or application, and achieving full accessibility requires attention to your usage, content, and overall structure.
          While implementing Solid Components into your product is a crucial initial step toward accessibility, it doesn't
          guarantee compliance. Each use of a component on a page necessitates consideration of context and content order,
          ensuring correct and meaningful semantics. Product teams must assume responsibility for maintaining compliance with
          these standards in their digital products based on Solid DS.

      <sd-accordion>
        <h4 class="text-base" slot="summary">Can I use the Solid Design System for my private projects?</h4>
        <span class="sd-prose">
          The Solid Design System is intended for use within the Union Investment universe. While it is an open-source project, [its commercial use is restricted to Union Investment](https://github.com/solid-design-system/solid?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme) and its associated projects. However, it can be used if the components' form and color are altered to avoid resemblance to the original corporate design. This "whitelabeling" process ensures the system is adapted to fit your project's unique style.

      What is the story behind the "Design Tokens"?
    </h4>
    <span class="sd-prose">
      Design tokens were first introduced by Salesforce in 2014. They have been used in design and development practices
      ever since. Design tokens are labels or names given to different design elements, such as colors, sizes, or fonts
      from design choices & decisions. They help separate specific values from the elements they represent. For example
      #181818 can be registered as “black" and #00358E as “blue.default". “black" and “blue.default" then can be used as
      text color options as “text.black" & “text.primary". By using design tokens, designers can easily update or change
      values without having to make adjustments everywhere. Tokens act as a central place to manage design values,
      making it easier to maintain a consistent design. For example another value can replace #181818 as an alias to the
      color token “black".

    <span class="sd-prose">
      The Solid Design System team does not impose strict rules on how design and development teams should operate.
      Instead, we offer guidance and best practices that promote collaboration, agility, and efficiency in integrating
      the design system into your workflow. The collaboration advice for consumers generally includes:

      **Shared Language and Terminology**<br></br>Ensuring that both designers and developers refer to components,
      colors, or tokens using a unified language helps avoid confusion and miscommunication during implementation.

      **Use of Agile Practices**<br></br>Consumers are encouraged to adopt agile workflows, such as frequent design and
      development sprints. This allows for continuous feedback and adjustments to ensure that both the design and
      development stay aligned​.

      **Design Systems as a Source of Truth**<br></br>The design system should serve as the central repository for all
      reusable components, ensuring consistency across teams and reducing the need for repetitive design work​.
