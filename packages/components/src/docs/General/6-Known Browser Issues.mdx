# Known Browser Issues

We've identified several browser issues that may affect visual consistency while using our components.
It's important for developers to be aware of these issues when implementing our components.

### Missing Border Radius for Focus Styles in Safari

In Safari, focus styles may lack border radius, unlike other browsers. This
inconsistency could affect design cohesion. While we can't fix it, developers
should be mindful of this behavior in Safari.

### Blurry Placeholder Image in Chrome

In Chrome, placeholder images may appear blurry at times. This is not a package issue but Chrome-specific behavior.

### Wobbly Spinner in Safari

"The 'sd-spinner' component may experience spinner animation issues in Safari, causing
them to appear wobbly. This behavior is beyond our control, so developers should be aware
of this when implementing the 'sd-spinner' component in Safari."

Being aware of these browser-specific issues is essential. While we cannot
directly resolve them, developers can make informed decisions and implement
any necessary workarounds when using our components.
