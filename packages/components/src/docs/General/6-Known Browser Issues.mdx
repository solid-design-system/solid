# Known Browser Issues

We've identified several browser issues that may affect visual consistency while using Solid Components.
It's important for developers to be aware of these issues when implementing our components.

## Missing Border Radius for Focus Styles in Safari

In Safari, focus styles may lack border radius, unlike other browsers. This
inconsistency could affect design cohesion.

## Blurry Placeholder Images in Chrome

In Chrome, our placeholder images may appear blurry at times. This is not a package issue but Chrome-specific behavior.

## Wobbly Spinner in Safari

The 'sd-spinner' component may experience spinner animation issues in Safari, causing
them to appear wobbly.

Being aware of these browser-specific issues is essential. While we cannot
directly resolve them, developers can make informed decisions and implement
any necessary workarounds when using Solid Components.
