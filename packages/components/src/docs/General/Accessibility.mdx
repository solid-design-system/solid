# Accessibility

Union Investment strives to offer digital products and services that are accessible to all, regardless of their abilities/limitations or the technology used. This is an accessibility checklist used by the SDS team when designing and developing new features. It helps us improve the experience for everyone who uses our product and ensures our high standards are met.

This is an ongoing process. We will continue to improve accessibility and meet at least the **WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines** - also with a view to the Barrier-Free Accessibility Strengthening Act that will come into force from 2025.

## Developing a WCAG-compliant Basis

We are committed to creating products that conform to the WCAG 2.1 guidelines, a standard also embraced by AK CD. This commitment includes a range of specific practices:

### Semantic Structure & HTML Usage

- **Native HTML over ARIA labels**: Always use native HTML instead of ARIA labels. This practice ensures that our content is as accessible as possible to a wide range of assistive technologies.

- **Semantically Correct Structure**: Implement a semantically correct structure, for example, H1 followed by H2, and P used for text, etc. This helps assistive technologies understand the structure and meaning of our content.

### Screen reader & keyboard controls

- **Keyboard-Accessible Elements**: All elements should be focusable only with the keyboard, in a desired order and with a visual focus. This assures that our content is accessible to users who rely on keyboard navigation.

- **Preserving ARIA Information**: Do not delete the ARIA information from the solid examples. They ensure correct interpretation by screen readers.

### Multimedia:

- **Alt text**: Provide alternative text for images, icons, and non-text content.

- **Captions and transcripts**: Always include captions and transcripts for videos and audio content.

- **Avoid auto-playing** audio and video without user controls.

### Color:

- **Color contrast**: Verify that color contrast meets the WCAG AA standard.
- **Color combinations**: Check color combinations for common forms of color blindness.

## Additionally, we incorporate the following practices to ensure accessibility:

- **Mouseless stories** to test and ensure all functionality is accessible without relying on mouse interactions.

- **A11y test cases**.

- **Focus visibility and order** for interactive elements.

## Integration into Processes as Definition-of-Done (DOD)

Accessibility is not an afterthought. It is integrated into our **Definition-of-Done**. This means that no work is considered complete until it meets our accessibility standards.

## The Importance of Web Accessibility

By making your website accessible, you ensure that all users, including people with disabilities, have a good user experience and can easily access information. Web accessibility includes all disabilities that affect access to the Internet, including auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, visual, and age-related impairments.

In Germany, about 0.4 percent of the population is visually impaired and about 0.1 percent of the inhabitants are auditorily impaired. Making sure our products are accessible opens them up to a wider audience and ensures that we are not excluding any potential users.

## What's New

We have made several changes to our design system to improve accessibility, including the following:

- **New approach to accentuation**: Omit using green text and use green only for graphical elements.

- **New look and feel**: Active component states are not always highlighted in green anymore. E.g. radio button groups.

- **New functional colors** are used for success and error messages as well as positive and negative (performance) values, notifications and badges. Also for notifications a new yellow color has been introduced as a warning color and a lightblue color as an informative color.

- **Usage limitations for colored text**: green text and graphical elements can only be used on the following backgrounds: white, primary, primary-100, neutral-100. On these backgrounds green text has a minium font size of 18.67px in bold and 24px in book. When inverted on green background only text colors white and primary can be used. On green background white text has a minimum font size of 18.67px in bold and 24px in book.

- **The CTA-Button** has a specific green background color that is only allowed for this variant.
