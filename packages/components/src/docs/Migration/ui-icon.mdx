# `ui-icon`

The new `sd-icon` is intended to be a direct replacement for `ui-icon`. It strives to mirror the attributes of an original HTML button, providing a wider range of features. Please refer to the `sd-icon` documentation for a comprehensive understanding of these attributes.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Independent from `global-resources`

There is no longer a need to import `global-resources` with the icon-provider + JSONs containing a list of icons. Instead, you implement your own resolver. This change enhances flexibility and performance. Refer to the `sd-icon` documentation for implementation details.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Flexible Size and Color Handling

The `size` and `color` attributes are inherited from the parent's `font-size` and `(text-)color` properties.

## ‚ú® New attribute: `color`

To ensure flexible coloring while simplifying skinning, we introduced the `color` attribute.

1. `currentColor` (default) inherits the text color from the parent element, mimicking the current CSS variable handling.
2. `primary` and `white` are self-explanatory, both being skinnable by default.

## ‚ú® New attribute: `src`

The `src` attribute allows you to fetch and set an icon from any URL.

## ‚ú® New attribute: `label`

The `label` attribute offers a way to describe the icon for screen readers.

## üîÄ Replaced attributes `icon`, `type`, `variant` with `name`

We removed the `icon`, `type`, and `variant` attributes.

1. The `variant` attribute is now obsolete, as color is managed via the `color` attribute.
2. The `type` and `icon` attributes are consolidated into the `name` attribute, e.g., `name='content/letter'`.

Ensure your resolver functions correctly. See the examples in the `sd-icon` documentation under `global-resources` and `global-resources-overridden` for guidance.

## ‚ùå CSS Variables: `--component-icon-...`

Component-specific CSS variables are discontinued. You can now override the icon's color using the `currentColor` attribute.
