# Migration Guide: From `ui-quotation` to `sd-quote`

The new `sd-quote` is designed to replace the `ui-quotation`. This transitions away from a component with attributes in favor of a pattern that encourages reusability. This pattern uses a combination of tokens and styles (e.g, sd-paragraph) to create `sd-quote`. You can take a look at the pattern [here](https://solid-design-system.fe.union-investment.de/x.x.x/storybook/?path=/docs/pattern-quote--docs) to use the pattern in your project.
