# Migration Guide: From `ui-quickfact-group` to `sd-quickfact`

## [`ui-quickfact-group`] is deprecated

The `ui-quickfact-group` component will not be a part of the SDS Library. The `sd-quickfact`, through the use of CSS parts and Javascript, can be customized to replicate the function of `ui-quickfact-group`.

The Solid Design System team has prepared a sample to demonstrate how to group `sd-quickfact` components. The sample includes scripts to close other quickfacts when one is opened, and equalizing summary heights for each quickfact in a row.
Refer to this [sample](https://solid-design-system.fe.union-investment.de/x.x.x/storybook/?path=/docs/components-sd-quickfact--docs#sample%3A%20grouping) for guidance.
