# `ui-accordion-panel`

The new `sd-accordion` is designed to replace the `ui-accordion-panel`. The new accordion component supports a wider range of attributes with correctly typed values.

## ‚ùå Removed attribute: `scrollTopSelector`

The `scrollTopSelector` attribute has been removed. If required, you can implement this functionality by listening to the appropriate event and manually handling the scroll behavior.

## ‚ú® New `slot` component

The new accordion iterates over the `summary` section in `ui-accordion-panel` by adding a new `slot` component. Slots have several new attributes available for better organization and granularity when designing accordions.
Here is a list of the attributes.

- `default`

  - Contains the main content of the accordion.

- `summary`

  - Provides the summary for the accordion header.
  - This can be an alternative to using the `summary` attribute directly inside the `sd-accordion` component (similar to `ui-accordion-panel`).

- `expand-icon`

  - an (optional) expand icon to use in the place of the default. Works best with `sd-icon`.

- `collapse-icon`

  - an (optional) collapse icon to use in the place of the default. Works best with `sd-icon`.

## üîÄ Event listner updates

This section covers the updates made to event listeners in the migration to Solid Components:

### üîÄ updated `panelOpen` to `sd-show` and `panelClose` to `sd-hide`

Event listeners `panelOpen` and `panelClose` have been replaced by sd-show`and`sd-hide` respectively. The behavior of these event listeners remains unchanged.

### ‚ùå Removed event: `panelClick`

We no longer support `panelClick` event.

### ‚ùå Removed event: `ready`

### ‚ú® New event `sd-after-hide`

This new event emits when the accordion closes and all the animations have completed.

### ‚ú® New event `sd-after-show`

Similar to `sd-after-hide`, this event emits when the accordion closes and all the animations have completed.

## üîÄ Updated methods: `toggle()` to `show()` and `hide()`

The toggle() method in `ui-accordion-panel` has been replaced by separate `show()` and `hide()` methods.
For detailed explanations and examples, take a look at the `sd-accordion` story.
