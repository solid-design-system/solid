# Migration Guide: From `ui-expandable` to `sd-expandable`

The new `sd-expandable` is designed to replace the `ui-expandable`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-expandable` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## ⚙️ Attributes

### ✨ New Attributes

#### [inverted]

Inverts the expandable and sets the color of the gradient to primary.

#### [variant]

Sets the height of the gradient to 24px for paragraph and 32px for leadtext.

## ✍️ CSS Variables

### ✨ New CSS Variables

#### [--gradient-color-start]

Start color of the gradient. The starting gradient should ideally have an opacity of 0 (default: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0))

#### [--gradient-color-end]

End color of the gradient. The ending gradient should ideally have an opacity of 1 (default: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1))
