# Migration Guide: From `ui-textarea` to `sd-textarea`

The new `sd-textarea` is designed to replace the `ui-textarea`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-textarea` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## üíæ Slots

### ‚ú® New Slots

#### [label]

The textarea's label. Alternatively, you can use the `label` attribute

#### [help-text]

Text that describes how to use the input. Alternatively, you can use the `help-text` attribute.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Attributes

### ‚ú® New Attributes

#### [title]

An empty title prevents browser validation tooltips from appearing on hover

#### [value]

The current value of the textarea, submitted as a name/value pair with form data.

#### [size]

#### [resize]

Controls how the textarea can be resized. Possible values are `none` and `vertical`, default is `vertical`.

#### [readonly]

Makes the textarea readonly.

#### [form]

By default, form controls are associated with the nearest containing `<form>` element. This attribute allows you
to place the form control outside of a form and associate it with the form that has this `id`. The form must be in
the same document or shadow root for this to work.

#### [minlength]

The minimum length of input that will be considered valid.

#### [autocapitalize]

[this page on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) for available values.

#### [autofocus]

Indicates that the input should receive focus on page load.

#### [enterkeyhint]

Used to customize the label or icon of the Enter key on virtual keyboards. Possible values are `enter`, `done`, `go`, `next`, `previous`, `search`, `send`.

#### [spellcheck]

Enables spell checking on the textarea.

#### [inputmode]

Tells the browser what type of data will be entered by the user, allowing it to display the appropriate virtual
keyboard on supportive devices. Possible values are `none` and `text`, default is `text`.
