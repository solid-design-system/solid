# Migration Guide: Deprication of `ui-qrcode`

## [`ui-qrcode`] is deprecated

The `ui-qrcode` component will not be a part of the SDS Library. We recommend building a custom qr code solution using the corresponding Shoelace component. Refer to the [Shoelace docs](https://shoelace.style/components/qr-code) for more information.
