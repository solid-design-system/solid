# Migration Guide: Deprecation of `ui-qrcode`

## [`ui-qrcode`] is deprecated

The `ui-qrcode` component will be deprecated and removed from the SDS Library. Since integrating QR code functionality is straightforward using third-party libraries or other web components, we believe there is no need to include it in the design system. This also helps us avoid increasing bundle sizes unnecessarily. If you still require a QR code component, please submit a feature request, and in the meantime, we recommend using the [Shoelace QR Code component](https://shoelace.style/components/qr-code) as an alternative.
