# Migration Guide: `ui-image`

The new `sd-media` and `sd-copyright` are designed to replace the `ui-image`. Rather than offering a complex component structure, they primarily focus on providing CSS styles.

Media no longer requires the `ui-image` wrapper and instead can directly utilize the provided CSS classes.

## üé® CSS Classes

### ‚ú® New CSS Classes

#### [sd-media]

The `sd-media` class is used to apply the basic styles to the media elements such as margin and default text color.

#### [sd-copyright]

The `sd-copyright` class is used to apply the basic styles to the copyright elements. It positions the element and defines padding, font size, color and text shadow.
