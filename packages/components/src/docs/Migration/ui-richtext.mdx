# Migration Guide: From `[ui-richtext]` to `[sd-prose]`

The new `[sd-prose]` is designed to replace the `[ui-richtext]`. Rather than offering a complex component structure, they primarily focus on providing CSS styles to enrich the text content.

## üíæ Slots

### ‚ùå Removed Slots

The following slots have been removed from the new [sd-prose] style:

1. [default]
   - As the new [sd-prose] is a CSS utility class, it does not require a slot.

<hr />

## ‚öôÔ∏è Attributes

3. [floating]
4. [variant]
