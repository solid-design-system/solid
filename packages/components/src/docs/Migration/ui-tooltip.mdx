# Migration Guide: From `ui-tooltip` to `sd-tooltip`

The new `sd-tooltip` is designed to replace the `ui-tooltip`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-tooltip` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## 💾 Slots

### 🔀 Updated Slots

#### [default] to [content]

Content is now added via the `content` slot instead of the `default` slot.

#### [trigger] to [default]

The tooltip trigger is now added via the `default` slot and has a default of the `info-circle` icon.

#### [disabled]
