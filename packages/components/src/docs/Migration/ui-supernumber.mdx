# Migration Guide: From `ui-supernumber` to `supernumber` pattern

The new `supernumber` pattern is designed to replace the `ui-supernumber`. This transitions away from a component with attributes in favor of a pattern that encourages reusability. It uses a combination of tokens and styles (e.g, sd-paragraph) to create a supernumber. Due to this attributes, events and methods from `ui-supernumber` are no longer used. You can take a look at the pattern [here](https://solid-design-system.fe.union-investment.de/x.x.x/storybook/?path=/docs/pattern-supernumber--docs) to use it in your project.
