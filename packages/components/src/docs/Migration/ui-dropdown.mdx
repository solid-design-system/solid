# Migration Guide: From `ui-dropdown` to `sd-dropdown`

The new `sd-dropdown` is designed to replace the `ui-dropdown`. Instead of providing content via attributes, the new dropdown uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## ‚ú® New Slot: `trigger`

The new `sd-dropdown` does not offer a direct trigger element. Instead, it leverages the `trigger` slot to determine the element that should invoke the dropdown. On top you can programmatically open the dropdown by setting the `open` property to `true`.

## ‚ùå Removed Attributes

The old `ui-dropdown` had several attributes that are no longer present in the `sd-dropdown` due to the redesigned approach using slots:

- `title` and `icon`: Previously used for the dropdown's appearance.
- `iconOption`: Determined if an icon can be added.
- `titleDisplayPosition`: Controlled the title's positioning.
- `links` and `utilityDropdownLinks`: Managed the links in the dropdown.
- `downloads` and `untilityDownloads`: Managed download links in the dropdown.

These functionalities are now inherently managed through the default and "trigger" slots in `sd-dropdown`, streamlining the component structure and allowing for more customization.

## üîÄ Updated Attributes

### üîÄ Updated Attribute: `open`

While both the old and new dropdown components have an `open` property to control the visibility of the dropdown, in the new `sd-dropdown`, it is exposed as a property which can be directly set to true or false.

### üîÄ Updated Attribute: `placement`

The old `dropdownPosition` has been replaced by the `placement` attribute. Here's how you can map the values:

- `bottom-left` in `ui-dropdown` translates to `bottom-start` in `sd-dropdown`.
- `bottom-right` in `ui-dropdown` translates to `bottom-end` in `sd-dropdown`.
- on top you have the possibility to set `top`, `left`, `right` including `*-start` and `*-end` variants, too.

## ‚ú® New Attributes

These are attributes that didn't exist in the old dropdown:

- `rounded`: To style the dropdown with rounded corners.
- `noAutoSize`: Controls the automatic resizing of content's width/height.
- `disabled`: Disables the dropdown.
- `stayOpenOnSelect`: Keeps the dropdown open after an item is selected.
- `containingElement`: The dropdown closes when the user interacts outside of this element.
- `distance`: Offset distance of the panel away from its trigger.
- `skidding`: Offset distance of the panel along its trigger.
- `hoist`: Option to prevent clipping of the panel when placed inside a container with `overflow: auto|scroll`.

## üîÑ Events Update

### Removed Events:

- `entryClick`: Emitted when an option in the menu was clicked.
- `toggle`: Emitted when the dropdown button was clicked. This event provided the open state of the dropdown.

You can still listen to your slotted `trigger` element or set click listeners on your slotted content.

### New Events:

- **`sd-show`**: Emitted when the dropdown opens.
- **`sd-after-show`**: Emitted after the dropdown has fully opened and all animations are complete.
- **`sd-hide`**: Emitted when the dropdown closes.
- **`sd-after-hide`**: Emitted after the dropdown has fully closed and all animations are complete.
