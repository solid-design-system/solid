# Migration Guide: From `ui-dropdown` to `sd-dropdown`

The new `sd-dropdown` is designed to replace the `ui-dropdown`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-dropdown` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## üíæ Slots

### ‚ú® New Slots

#### [trigger]

The new `sd-dropdown` does not offer a direct trigger element. Instead, it leverages the `trigger` slot to determine the element that should invoke the dropdown. On top you can programmatically open the dropdown by setting the `open` property to `true`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Attributes

### ‚ú® New Attributes

#### [rounded]

To style the dropdown with rounded corners.

#### [noAutoSize]

Controls the automatic resizing of content's width/height.

#### [disabled]

Disables the dropdown.

#### [stayOpenOnSelect]

Keeps the dropdown open after an item is selected.

#### [containingElement]

The dropdown closes when the user interacts outside of this element.

#### [distance]

Offset distance of the panel away from its trigger.

#### [skidding]

Offset distance of the panel along its trigger.

#### [hoist]

Option to prevent clipping of the panel when placed inside a container with `overflow: auto|scroll`.

### üîÄ Updated Attributes

#### [open]

While both the old and new dropdown components have an `open` property to control the visibility of the dropdown, in the new `sd-dropdown`, it is exposed as a property which can be directly set to true or false.

#### [placement]

The old `dropdownPosition` has been replaced by the `placement` attribute. Here's how you can map the values:

- `bottom-left` in `ui-dropdown` translates to `bottom-start` in `sd-dropdown`.
- `bottom-right` in `ui-dropdown` translates to `bottom-end` in `sd-dropdown`.
- on top you have the possibility to set `top`, `left`, `right` including `*-start` and `*-end` variants, too.

1. [title & icon]
