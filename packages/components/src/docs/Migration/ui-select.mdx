# Migration Guide: From `ui-select` to `sd-select`

The new `sd-select` is designed to replace the `ui-select`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-select` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## 💾 Slots

### ✨ New Slots

#### label

The input's label. Alternatively, you can use the label attribute.

#### left

Used to prepend a presentational icon or similar element to the combobox.

#### help-text

Text that describes how to use the input. Alternatively, you can use the help-text attribute.

#### clear-icon

An icon to use in lieu of the default clear icon.

#### expand-icon

The icon to show when the control is expanded and collapsed. Rotates on open and close.

<hr />

## ⚙️ Attributes

### ✨ New Attributes

#### size

The select's size.

#### placeholder

Placeholder text to show as a hint when the select is empty.

#### placement

The preferred placement of the select's menu. Note that the actual placement may vary as needed to keep the listbox inside of the viewport.

#### clearable

Adds a clear button when the select is not empty.

#### max-options-visible

The maximum number of selected options to show when `multiple` and `checklist` are `true`. After the maximum, "+n" will be shown to indicate the number of additional items that are selected. Set to 0 to remove the limit.

#### form

By default, form controls are associated with the nearest containing form element. This attribute allows you to place the form control outside of a form and associate it with the form that has this id. The form must be in the same document or shadow root for this to work.

#### name

The name of the select, submitted as a name/value pair with form data.

### 🔀 Updated Attributes

#### help-text

Replaces `hint`. If you need to display HTML, use the `help-text` slot instead.

#### multiple & checklist

Two boolean attributes that replace `variant`. `multiple` enables multiple options to be selected but does not show them in the display input. `checklist` alters the multiple variant to use a list of checkbox style options in addition to showing individual `sd-tag` elements in the display input.

#### value

The current value of the select, submitted as a name/value pair with form data. When multiple is enabled, the value attribute will be a space-delimited list of values based on the options selected, and the value property will be an array. For this reason, values must not contain spaces.

#### hoist

Enable this option to prevent the listbox from being clipped when the component is placed inside a container with overflow: auto|scroll. Hoisting uses a fixed positioning strategy that works in many, but not all, scenarios.

#### getTag

A function that customizes the tags to be rendered when multiple=true. The first argument is the option, the second is the current tag's index. The function should return either a Lit TemplateResult or a string containing trusted HTML of the symbol to render at the specified value.
