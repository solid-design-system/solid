# `sd-spinner`: Replacement for `ui-loading-spinner`

The new `sd-spinner` is designed to replace the `ui-loading-spinner`.

## ✨ New attribute: `color`

The `ui-loading-spinner` managed its color through global skinning. The `sd-spinner` uses the `color` attribute for color setting, ensuring better consistency with other components.

## ❌ Removed fixed size

The `ui-loading-spinner` had a fixed size of `25px`. The `sd-spinner`, on the other hand, is fully responsive and can be sized using CSS via the `font-size` property. Its default size is `1em`, which is equivalent to `16px` by default.
