# Migration Guide: From `ui-loading-spinner` to `sd-spinner`

The new `sd-spinner` is designed to replace the `ui-loading-spinner`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-spinner` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## ⚙️ Attributes

### ✨ New Attributes

#### [color]

The `ui-loading-spinner` managed its color through global skinning. The `sd-spinner` uses the `color` attribute for color setting, ensuring better consistency with other components.

## 💪 Additional Changes

### ❌ Removed fixed size

The `ui-loading-spinner` had a fixed size of `25px`. The `sd-spinner`, on the other hand, is fully responsive and can be sized using CSS via the `font-size` property. Its default size is `1em`, which is equivalent to `16px` by default.
