# Migration Guide: From `[ui-progress-steps]` to `[sd-step-group]`

The new `[sd-step-group]` is designed to replace the `[ui-progress-steps]`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `[sd-step-group]` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## 💾 Slots

### ✨ New Slots

#### [default]

Used for grouping steps in the step group. Must be `<sd-step>` elements.

<hr />

## ⚙️ Attributes

### ✨ New Attributes

#### [orientation]

Determines the orientation of the step-group.

#### [not-interactive]

Sets the step-group to an non-interactive state. This enabled the step to be used as a visual indicator and not navigation.

### ❌ Removed Attributes

The following attributes have been removed from the new [sd-step-group] component:

1. [cornered]
2. [showFirstEllipsis]
3. [showLastEllipsis]
4. [variant]

<hr />

## 🧪 Methods

### ✨ New Methods

#### [setActiveStep]

Sets the active step to the step with the given index.
