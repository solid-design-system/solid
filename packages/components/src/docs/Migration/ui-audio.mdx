# Migration Guide: From `[ui-audio-player]` to `[sd-audio]`

The new `[sd-audio]` is designed to replace the `[ui-audio-player]`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `[sd-audio]` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## 💾 Slots

### ✨ New Slots

#### [play-icon]

Slot for the play icon.

#### [pause-icon]

Slot for the pause icon.

#### [transcript]

Slot for the transcript.

### 🔀 Updated Slots

#### [default]

The default slot is used to define the audio element.

## ⚙️ Attributes

### ✨ New Attributes

#### [reversedLayout]

Reverts the order of the audio controls and timestamps.

#### [hideTimestamps]

Hides the timestamps.

### 🔀 Updated Attributes

#### [isPlaying]

`started` as been replaced by `isPlaying` attribute. The default value is **false**.

### ❌ Removed Attributes

The following attributes have been removed from the new [ui-audio-player] component:

1. [preload]

- The new component is designed as only a wrapper for the audio element, so the preload attribute is not needed.

2. [src]

- This attribute is no longer needed as the audio element is now passed as a slot.
