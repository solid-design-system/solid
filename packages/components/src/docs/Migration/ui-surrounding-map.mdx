# Migration Guide: Deprecation of `ui-surrounding-map`

## [`ui-surrounding-map`] is deprecated

The `ui-surrounding-map` component will not be a part of the SDS Library. This component was heavily tied to the Google Maps API, offering little beyond a restyled Google Map at the cost of integrating a large library and significantly increasing our bundle size.

For your map-related needs, use the [Google Maps Style Wizard](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/) to create a custom map style and use [`sd-map-marker`](https://solid-design-system.fe.union-investment.de/x.x.x/storybook/?path=/docs/components-sd-map-marker--docs) to display markers on the map. A starter guide for the Google Map Style Wizard will be made available in future.
