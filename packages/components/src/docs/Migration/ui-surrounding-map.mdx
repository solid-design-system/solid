# Migration Guide: Deprecation of `ui-surrounding-map`

## [`ui-surrounding-map`] is deprecated

The `ui-surrounding-map` component will not be a part of the SDS Library. This component was heavily dependent on the Google Maps API and had often changing requirements.

For your map-related needs, use the [Google Maps Style Wizard](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/) to create a custom map style and use [`sd-map-marker`](https://solid-design-system.fe.union-investment.de/x.x.x/storybook/?path=/docs/components-sd-map-marker--docs) to display markers on the map.
