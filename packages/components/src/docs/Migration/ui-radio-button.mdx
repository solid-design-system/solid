# Migration Guide: From `ui-radio-button` to `sd-radio-button`

The new `sd-radio-button` is designed to replace the `ui-radio-button`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-radio-button` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## 💾 Slots

### ✨ New Slots

#### [default]

The radio button's label.

#### [icon]

A presentational radio button icon.

<hr />

## ⚙️ Attributes

### ✨ New Attributes

#### [size]

The radio button's size. The default is lg, but it can also be md or sm.

### ❌ Removed Attributes

The following attributes have been removed from the new [sd-radio-button] component:

1. [showLabel]
2. [isFirstButton]
3. [isLastButton]

These properties were removed as style adjustments are now handled by the parent group component.

<hr />

## 🥳 Events

### ✨ New Events

#### [sd-focus]

This event is dispatched when the sd-radio-button receives focus.

#### [sd-blur]

This event is dispatched when the sd-radio-button loses focus.

<hr />

## 🦻 Event Listeners

### ❌ Removed Event Listeners:

The following event listeners have been removed from the new [ui-radio-button] component:

1. [uiRadioButtonClick]
2. [UiInputChangeEvent]

<hr />

## 💪 Additional Changes

### [ui-radio-button-group] is now part of [sd-radio-group]

`sd-radio-group` is used to group multiple radios or radio buttons so they function as a single form control. Radio groups include a set of radios in which only one radio can be selected at a time.
