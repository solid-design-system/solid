# `ui-offcanvas-panel`

The new `sd-drawer` is designed to replace the `ui-offcanvas-panel`, with more intuitive slots for content organization and an improved API. This guide will help you migrate from the old component to the new one. Please refer to the `sd-drawer` documentation for a full overview of all attributes and events.

## ‚ú® New Slots: `header` and `footer`

The `sd-drawer` introduces new slots for `header` and `footer`, allowing you to structure your content more effectively. The `header` is typically used for a title, while the `footer` can contain buttons representing various options.

```html
<sd-drawer>
  <div slot="header">Your Title Here</div>
  <div slot="footer">
    <button>Cancel</button>
    <button>Confirm</button>
  </div>
  Your main content goes here...
</sd-drawer>
```

## ‚ùå Removed Attributes: `darken`, `closeOutside` and `activeBelow`

The `darken`, `closeOutside` and `activeBelow` attributes are no longer provided. The `darken` attribute previously controlled the appearance of the overlay, and `closeOutside` allowed users to close the drawer by clicking outside of it. The new `sd-drawer` design makes these features redundant.

## üîÄ Updated Attribute: `position` to `placement`

The `position` attribute has been replaced with `placement`. The `placement` attribute indicates the direction from which the drawer will open, with the options being 'end' or 'start'.

```html
<sd-drawer placement="start">
  <!-- Your content -->
</sd-drawer>
```

## ‚ùå Removed Event: `offcanvasTrigger`

The `offcanvasTrigger` event has been removed. The open state of the drawer is now controlled through the `open` property or the `show()` and `hide()` methods.

```html
<sd-drawer open>...</sd-drawer>
```

or

```
const drawer = document.querySelector('sd-drawer');
drawer.show(); // or drawer.hide();
```

## ‚ùå Removed Components: `ui-offcanvas-trigger` and `ui-offcanvas-provider`

The `ui-offcanvas-trigger` and `ui-offcanvas-provider` components are no longer needed. The `sd-drawer` can be controlled directly through its properties and methods, simplifying its usage.

## ‚ú® New Properties: `label` and `no-header`

The `label` property allows you to provide an accessible name for the drawer, which is essential for proper accessibility.

The `no-header` property lets you remove the default header, including the close button. If you use this property, make sure you provide an easy, accessible way for users to dismiss the drawer.

```html
<sd-drawer label="My Drawer" noHeader>
  <!-- Your content -->
</sd-drawer>
```

## New and Updated CSS Parts and Properties

The `sd-drawer` provides a range of CSS parts for easier styling, including `base`, `overlay`, `panel`, `header`, `title`, `close-button`, `body`, and `footer`. You can target these parts for custom styles.

The `--width` CSS property allows you to specify the preferred width of the drawer.

```css
sd-drawer::part(panel) {
  --width: 400px;
}
```

Make sure to update your styles to utilize these new CSS parts and properties.
