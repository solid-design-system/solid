# Introduction for Migration

This is the migration guide for the Solid Design System from "Component Library" (built with Stencil) to "Solid Components" (built with LitElement).

## Global Changes

### CSS Variables

We have discontinued component-specific CSS variables. You can now alter colors and padding using the part selector. Alternatively, override CSS variables used within the element as needed.

```css
sd-button::part(base) {
  background: pink;
  color: black;
}
```

As an alternative you can override CSS variables used in the element:

```css
sd-button {
  --sd-spacing-4: 15px; /* overrides default 16px */
}
```
