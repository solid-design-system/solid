# Introduction for Migration

This is the migration guide for the Solid Design System from "Component Library" (built with Stencil) to "Solid Components" (built with LitElement).

## Global Changes

### CSS Variables

We have discontinued component-specific CSS variables. You can now alter colors and padding using the part selector. Alternatively, override CSS variables used within the element as needed.

```css
sd-button::part(base) {
  background: pink;
  color: black;
}
```

As an alternative you can override CSS variables used in the element:

```css
sd-button {
  --sd-spacing-4: 15px; /* overrides default 16px */
}
```

### 🚫 Discontinued ui-components from [Component Library](https://component-library.fe.union-investment.de/latest/storybook/index.html) 🚫

Teams that have been using the following components should be aware that they will **not** be supported in the **Solid Design System (SDS) library**. If you have been relying on these components, it’s essential to implement their functionality in your own custom library.

> Note: Our practice involves detailed discussions about each UI component before migrating it into the SDS. As a result, this list will be regularly updated and adjusted.

- ui-contact
- ui-link-list
- ui-superteaser
- ui-tag-group

### Most likely discontinued ui-components 🚫 ⁇ 🚫

**Ui-components** from the following list appear unlikely to be included in the SDS Library, as they are highly specific to a **CMS context**.

> Note: This list is **highly non-binding** since we have not yet begun discussions about these components. If you are considering migrating any of them in the near future, please reach out to the SDS team for further evaluation.
