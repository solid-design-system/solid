# Migration Guide: From `ui-slider` to `sd-carousel`

The new `sd-carousel` is designed to replace the `ui-slider`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-carousel` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## üíæ Slots

### ‚ú® New Slots

#### [next-icon]

An optional next icon that can be used instead of the default. This works best with `<sd-icon>`.

#### [previous-icon]

An optional previous icon that can be used instead of the default. This works best with `<sd-icon>`.

#### [autoplay-start]

An optional icon slot to replace the start/play button that appears when `autoplay` is set to true. Works best with `<sd-icon>`.

#### [autoplay-pause]

An optional icon slot to replace the pause button that appears when `autoplay` is set to true. Works best with `<sd-icon>`.
