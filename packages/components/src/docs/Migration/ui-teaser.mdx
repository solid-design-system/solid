## üîÄ Updated Attributes

### üîÄ Updated Attribute: `variant`

The `variant` attribute has been updated to support the following values : `white` | `white border-neutral-300` | `neutral-100` | `primary` | `primary-100`.

### ‚ú® New Attribute: `breakpoint`

The `breakpoint` attribute is a new addition that determines when the teaser switches from `vertical` to `horizontal`. `0` is always `horizontal`, `9999` is always `vertical`. Default value is `448`.

### ‚ú® New attribute: `inset`

The `inset` attribute is used to set the inner padding of the teaser. This is always set in `white border-neutral-300` variant.

## ‚ú® New `slots`

The new `sd-teaser` component uses slots to create a more customizable and flexible component structure. Here are the new slots available:

- `default` - Contains the main content of the teaser.

- `media` - A slot to provide media content for the teaser.

- `meta` - A slot for presenting metadata related to the teaser.

- `headline` - A slot for the headline of the teaser.

### ‚ú® New CSS Properties

The new sd-teaser component introduces two new CSS properties:

`--distribution-media` - The distribution ratio of the media.

`--distribution-content` - The distribution ratio of the content.

This can only be used when the orientation is horizontal. In case there's a requirement to have a fixed value for the media or content, you can override the sd-teaser::part(media) or sd-teaser::part(content) selector by applying a flex-shrink of 0.

```css
sd-teaser::part(media) {
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

The following events and methods have been removed from the new teaser component:

- `componentResized`
- `linkClick`
- `onAfterResize`
- `hasLinks`
- `createLink` - You can use the slot system to add links or any other elements to the `sd-teaser`.
