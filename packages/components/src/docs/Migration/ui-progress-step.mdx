# Migration Guide: From `[ui-progress-step]` to `[sd-step]`

The new `[sd-step]` is designed to replace the `[ui-progress-step]`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `[sd-step]` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## 💾 Slots

### ✨ New Slots

#### [default]

The step's description.

#### [label]

The step's label.

#### [circle-content]

The content inside a step circle. This could be an icon or a number.

#### [index]

The step's index.

<hr />

## ⚙️ Attributes

### ✨ New Attributes

#### [size]

The step's size.

#### [orientation]

Determines the orientation of the step.

#### [disabled]

Sets the step to a disabled state.

#### [current]

Sets the step to an active state.

#### [no-tail]

Removes the tail from the step.

#### [description]

The step's description overwriting the `description` slot. Use the `description` slot for complex description content.

#### [href]

When set, the underlying button will be rendered as an `<a>` with this `href` instead of a `<button>`.

#### [not-interactive]

Sets the step to an non-interactive state. This enabled the step to be used as a visual indicator and not navigation.

### ❌ Removed Attributes

The following attributes have been removed from the new [sd-step] component:

1. [active]
2. [cornered]
3. [done]
4. [ellipsis]
5. [variant]

<hr />

## 🥳 Events

### ✨ New Events

#### [sd-focus]

This event is dispatched when the sd-step receives focus.

#### [sd-blur]

This event is dispatched when the sd-step loses focus.
