# `ui-button`

Solid Components aims to mirror default HTML behavior as closely as possible. The new `sd-button` component supports a range of attributes with correctly typed values. It replaces the `ui-button` with enhanced features and functionality. To understand all the available attributes, please refer to the `sd-button` documentation.

## ✨ New attribute: `load`

The `load` attribute improves handling of buttons that display a loading state. In the past, manual intervention was necessary to control this state. Now, simply set the `load` attribute. It activates an `sd-spinner`, maintains the current content (and consequently, the width), and manages all essential HTML and A11y features.

## 🔀 Updated attribute: `variant/transparent` to `variant/tertiary`

The attribute argument `variant/transparent` has been renamed to `variant/tertiary` to accurately represent the button hierarchy. To enhance user experience, its behavior on hover has been updated; it now changes background instead of applying an underline.

## ❌ CSS Variables: `--component-button-...`

We have discontinued component-specific CSS variables. You can now alter colors and padding using the part selector. Alternatively, override CSS variables used within the element as needed.

```css
sd-button::part(base) {
  background: pink;
  color: black;
}
```

As an alternative you can override CSS variables used in the element:

```css
sd-button {
  --sd-spacing-4: 15px; // overrides default 16px
}
```

## ❌ Removed attribute: `variant/plain`

We no longer support manually setting negative margins for aligning a tertiary button horizontally. Design-wise, this approach is discouraged as the hover and focus states would be affected. If you require a more minimal link component, please utilize the `sd-link` component. Note that the `sd-link` component is not designed to behave like a button and will not support such features in the future.

## ❌ Removed attribute: `icon`

The `sd-button` no longer includes an `icon` attribute. Instead, it provides a slot for the same purpose. For usage examples, refer to the `sd-button/Slots` story. You might need to manually add 'skinning' data to invert the icon, as this function is no longer provided by the button.

```html
<sd-button
  <ui-icon slot="icon-left" ...></ui-icon>.
</sd-button>.
```

See the `sd-button/Slots` story for examples.

## ✨ New `icon-only` state

The `icon-only` state activates when an `sd-icon` is placed inside the main slot of an `sd-button`. In this state, the button automatically becomes square, embodying an `icon-only` button.

## ❌ Automatic Color Inversion

In our pursuit of creating standalone, robust components, the `sd-button` does not automatically invert its colors based on CSS variables from higher elements in the DOM. Instead, to invert colors, you simply need to add the `inverted` attribute.
