# Migration Guide: From `[ui-flashcard]` to `[sd-flipcard]`

The new `[sd-flipcard]` is designed to replace the `[ui-flashcard]`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `[sd-flipcard]` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## 💾 Slots

#### [front]

The front of the card.

#### [back]

The back of the card.

#### [mediaFront]

An optional media slot which can be as a background. Dependent from gradient variant.
