## ‚ú® New `slot` component

The new accordion iterates over the `summary` section in `ui-accordion` by adding a new `slot` component. Slots have several new attributes available for better organization and granularity when designing accordions.
Here is a list of the attributes. For detailed explanations and examples, take a look at the `sd-accordion` story.

### `default`

    * Contains the main content of the accordion.

### `summary`

    * Provides the summary for the accordion header.
    * This can be an alternative to using the `summary` attribute directly inside the `sd-accordion` component (similar to `ui-accordion`).

### `expand-icon`

    * an (optional) expand icon to use in the place of the default. Works best with `sd-icon`.

### `collapse-icon`

    * an (optional) collapse icon to use in the place of the default. Works best with `sd-icon`.

## üîÄ Updated methods: `toggle()` to `show()` and `hide()`

The toggle() method in `ui-accordion` has been replaced by separate `show()` and `hide()` methods.
