# `ui-tag`

The new `sd-tag` is designed to replace the `ui-tag` and provide enhanced functionality. To understand all the available attributes, please refer to the `sd-tag` documentation.

## ‚ú® New attributes: `href`, `target` and `download`

When the new `href` attribute is set the `sd-tag` component renders as a link (`<a>`) and not (as per default) as a button (`<button>`). The additional `target` attribute controls where the browser should open the link, the `download` attribute may be used to tell the browser to download the linked file with the specified filename. If the `href` attribute is omitted, the `target` and `download` attribute are ignored.

**Hint:** When the `href` attribute is set i.e. the `sd-tag` is rendered as a link (`<a>`), the `disabled` attribute is ignored, as links may not be disabled. To disable the `sd-tag` the `href` attribute has to be removed as well.

## ‚ú® New attribute: `removable`

The new `removable` attribute controls whether or not the tag should display a small close icon (`x`) next to the label of the tag to indicate that the filtered attribute may be removed.

## ‚ú® New attribute: `size`

The `sd-tag` component offers two different sizes:

- `lg` is the default size
- `sm` size is an alternative size for use in very tight spaces

## ‚ùå Removed CSS Variables

Component-specific CSS variables have been discontinued. Now, you can override colors and padding using the part selector.

```css
sd-tag::part(base) {
  background: pink;
  color: black;
}
```

## ‚ùå Removed default click handler

The `sd-tag` component does not provide a default handler/behavior for click events. Therefore, the `value` attribute has been removed as well.

## ‚ùå Removed attribute: `labelId`

The `sd-tag` no longer has a label part and therefore does not provide a `labelId` attribute.

## üîÄ Updated attribute: `checked` to `selected`

The attribute `checked` has been renamed to `selected`.
