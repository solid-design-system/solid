# Migration Guide: From `ui-video` to `sd-video`

The new `sd-video` is designed to replace the `ui-video`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-video` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

## 💾 Slots

### ✨ New Slots

#### [default]

The default slot is used to pass a video player element.

#### [play-icon]

The slot for the video's play icon.

#### [poster]

Slot to specify an image to be shown before initial play of the wrapped video. This acts like the `poster` attribute on the native video tag.

<hr />

## ⚙️ Attributes

### ✨ New Attributes

#### [playing]

Setting this to `true` will hide the play icon and the overlay.

#### [isBelowBreakpoint]

Used to set a reactive property to trigger breakpoint re-renders.
