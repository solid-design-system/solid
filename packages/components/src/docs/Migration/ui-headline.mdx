# Migration Guide: From `ui-headline` to `sd-headline`

The new `sd-headline` is designed to replace the `ui-headline`. Rather than offering a complex component structure, they primarily focus on providing CSS styles for heading elements. Make sure to provide correct semantics yourself, e. g. `<h2>`.

## 🎨 CSS Classes

### ✨ New CSS Classes

#### [sd-headline]

The `sd-headline` class is intended for use with heading elements (e.g., `h1`, `h2`, etc.) which are vital for displaying content hierarchy and to improve accessibility.

#### [sd-headline--size-...]

The `sd-headline--size-...` classes define the size of the headline. The options (excluding the default value) include `3xl`, `xl`, `lg` and `base`.

#### [sd-headline--inverted]

This class inverts the headline text.

#### [sd-headline--inline]

This class sets inline behavior. It should be used exclusively when an sd-icon or other component is present.
