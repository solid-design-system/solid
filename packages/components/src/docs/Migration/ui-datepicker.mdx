# Migration Guide: From `ui-datepicker` to `sd-input` with `flatpicker`

## [`ui-datepicker`] is deprecated

The `ui-datepicker` component will not be a part of the SDS Library. The `sd-input` along with `flatpicker` can be used to replicate the function of `ui-datepicker`. Refer to these [samples](https://solid-design-system.fe.union-investment.de/x.x.x/storybook/?path=/docs/components-sd-input--docs#sample%3A%20datepicker) for guidance.
