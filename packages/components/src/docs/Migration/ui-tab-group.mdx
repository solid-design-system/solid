# Migration Guide: From `ui-tab-group` to `sd-tab-group`

The new `sd-tab-group` is designed to replace the `ui-tab-group`. Instead of mainly providing content via attributes, the `sd-tab-group` component uses slots to allow for more flexibility and customization.

Used for grouping tab panels in the tab group. Must be `<sd-tab-panel>` elements.
