              Our investment philosophy is based on our belief that markets are inefficient. Long-term outperformance
              is, therefore, best achieved through a combination of fundamental research, actively managed security
              selection and robust risk management. This conviction lies at the heart of all our investment solutions.
              We offer a transparent investment process, which allows clients to keep track of our investment decisions.

              We take an integrated approach to portfolio management, with every portfolio manager also acting as a

              ensure accountability for investment performance.
