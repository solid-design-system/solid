            No statement is made about future performance. The foreign currency quota takes into account the entire fund
            assets, including target fund resolution and cash. The key figures average yield, average coupon, average
            remaining maturity, average duration, and modified duration are calculated including target fund resolution
            based on the fixed-income assets and taking into account cash and derivatives. In the calculation of the
            average remaining maturity, floaters are considered with their final maturity. The average rating is a
            proprietary calculation by Union Investment (Union Comp Rating) based on the fixed-income assets, taking
            into account cash and excluding derivatives. All allocation views and the fund structure are based on the
            target fund-resolved economic holdings of the fund. Hedging positions through derivatives are offset.
          </p>
          <p class="sd-paragraph">
            All allocation views are presented excluding cash and foreign and real estate funds. The allocation of the
            fund structure is based on Union Investment Group’s own asset allocation. The allocations may differ from
            those in the annual and semi-annual reports. The sector allocation for equities is based on MSCI sectors or
            for fixed income on Merrill-Lynch sectors of the assets. The distribution yield in % is the “current yield”
            in the respective fiscal year. The basis for this is the net asset value at the beginning of the respective
            fiscal year, adjusted for the distribution included in the previous fiscal year.
