    * This is a helper component to quickly add a focus outline to an element.
    * Known issue: Safari renders always square outlines.
    * We could fix this by using box-shadows, but we then would have to use ring-offset-color (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/ring-offset-color) to fake the offset.
    * As we don't know the background color of the focused element, this is not possible. Therefore we're using outlines and wait until Safari gets it fixed.
